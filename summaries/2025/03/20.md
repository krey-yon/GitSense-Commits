# Activity Summary for 3/20/2025

## 5:01:19 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `meme-uploadpage.tsx` between 4:03 PM and 4:06 PM on March 20, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, which allows users to upload meme images, remains consistent throughout all revisions.  The changes primarily involve commenting out sections of code related to text formatting options.

Specifically,  the `TextFormatting` component import is commented out in all revisions after the initial one.  Furthermore, state variables related to text formatting (`position`, `textColor`, `fontSize`, `textAlign`, `isBold`, `isItalic`) are progressively commented out in subsequent revisions.  The commented-out code suggests the removal of features to allow users to customize the text position, color, size, alignment, boldness and italics on their uploaded memes. The preview section of the meme, where the caption was displayed, is also commented out in later revisions.  This suggests a simplification of the meme uploading process, focusing solely on image upload and caption generation rather than advanced caption formatting.  The upload functionality via the `convertToImageAndCreateFormData` and `uploadToCloudinary` functions remains unchanged, sending the image and caption to an API endpoint (`/api/upload`).
