# Activity Summary for 3/20/2025

## 5:01:19 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `meme-uploadpage.tsx` between 4:03 PM and 4:06 PM on March 20, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, which allows users to upload meme images, remains consistent throughout all revisions.  The changes primarily involve commenting out sections of code related to text formatting options.

Specifically,  the `TextFormatting` component import is commented out in all revisions after the initial one.  Furthermore, state variables related to text formatting (`position`, `textColor`, `fontSize`, `textAlign`, `isBold`, `isItalic`) are progressively commented out in subsequent revisions.  The commented-out code suggests the removal of features to allow users to customize the text position, color, size, alignment, boldness and italics on their uploaded memes. The preview section of the meme, where the caption was displayed, is also commented out in later revisions.  This suggests a simplification of the meme uploading process, focusing solely on image upload and caption generation rather than advanced caption formatting.  The upload functionality via the `convertToImageAndCreateFormData` and `uploadToCloudinary` functions remains unchanged, sending the image and caption to an API endpoint (`/api/upload`).


## 6:01:19 PM
The `leaderboard.tsx` component displays a top 10 meme leaderboard, sortable by rank or likes.  The initial commit on March 20, 2025, at 6:01:08 PM, shows a functional component fetching data from a hardcoded `memes` array.  The component renders a grid of meme cards, each displaying rank, title, caption, likes count, and an image.  Users can toggle sorting between "rank" and "likes" using a button.  The UI utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide-React for icons. The meme data includes placeholder images ("/placeholder.svg").  The component dynamically calculates the rank when sorting by likes.


## 7:01:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `meme.ts` file between 6:44 PM and 6:47 PM on March 20, 2025.  These revisions focus primarily on the `top10Memes` function.  The initial versions of this function were incomplete or contained errors.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: fetching the top 10 memes based on like count using Prisma ORM.  Changes involve refining the data transformation within the `formattedPosts` array, specifically correcting how `liked` status was determined. The final version at 6:47:58 PM accurately checks if the current user liked a post by comparing `userId` with `post.authorId` instead of `findUser.id`, fixing a potential logic error.  The other functions (`getMemesActions`, `getFilterMeme`, `uploadMeme`, `updateMemeLike`, `getComments`, `addComments`) remain unchanged across all revisions.  The consistent use of `try...catch` blocks indicates a focus on error handling throughout the file.


## 9:01:26 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `leaderboard.tsx` component and the `page.tsx` file in a Next.js application.  The major changes are focused on the `leaderboard` component, which displays a list of memes.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Memeverse\src\components\leaderboard.tsx`**:

Initially, the component fetched meme data incorrectly (using `sortedMemes` which was never defined).  Between 8:09 PM and 8:12 PM, the code was revised to fetch top 10 memes using `top10Memes` from  `@/actions/meme`, adding `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for asynchronous data fetching and state management.  At 8:11 PM an `interface Meme` was added to define the structure of each meme object, improving type safety.  Then between 8:12 PM and 8:14 PM, the ranking display was removed, and the image source was changed from `meme.image` to `meme.imageUrl`. Further alterations around 8:14 PM involved removing the sort functionality and replacing the `ThumbsUp` icon with `Heart` icon.  Finally, the loading state was added (around 8:47 PM and onwards) using a loading indicator (`/svgs/loading.svg` and later `/image/flow.gif`) to enhance user experience during data fetching.  The loading indicator was improved significantly in terms of visual presentation between 8:54 PM and 8:57 PM, settling on a full-screen loading animation with a loading message.  Throughout this period, there were several minor formatting and variable name changes. The final version uses the `meme.caption` for both the title and description.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Memeverse\src\app\leaderboard\page.tsx`**:

This file initially had empty or very basic code.  Significant changes occurred between 8:16 PM and 8:17 PM.  Around 8:17 PM, the page was updated to correctly render the `MemeLeaderboard` component within a `Suspense` component, which handles loading states.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Memeverse\src\components\Navbar.tsx`**:

This file underwent minor edits between 8:18 PM and 8:46 PM, correcting a typo in "Leadboard" to "Leaderboard" in the mobile navigation menu.  The structure of the Navbar remains largely consistent showing a responsive design for desktop and mobile.

In summary, the majority of development effort focused on refining the leaderboard component to fetch and display meme data correctly and efficiently, with a clear focus on improving user experience through the addition of a loading indicator.  The `page.tsx` file only required simple integration of the component. The Navbar component received only minor stylistic and functional corrections.
