# Activity Summary for 3/8/2025

The log shows a series of modifications to `meme-card.tsx` between 11:46 PM and 11:50 PM on March 7, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the refactoring of the like functionality.

Initially, the component used both `likeMeme` and `updateMemeLike` API calls, along with local storage for optimistic updates and error handling.  Between 11:46 PM and 11:48 PM, the `handleLike` function (using `likeMeme`) was completely removed and commented out.  The `isLoading` state variable was also removed at this time.

The component then relied solely on the `updateMemeLike` function, utilizing  `useOptimistic` and `useTransition` hooks for handling optimistic updates. The `handleNewLike` function was introduced or significantly altered during this period to incorporate these hooks.  This change improves user experience by providing immediate visual feedback on like changes, while still maintaining data integrity through server-side validation.

Between 11:48 PM and 11:50 PM, the `useEffect` hooks managing local storage for liked status and like counts were commented out.  This suggests a move towards relying entirely on optimistic updates and server-side data management, eliminating the need for local storage redundancy. Finally, a minor type correction was made to the `useOptimistic` hook's second argument, clarifying the types of `state` and `newState`.  This last change improves code clarity and maintainability.  The overall change pattern indicates a simplification and enhancement of the like functionality, focusing on a more efficient and user-friendly approach using React's built-in concurrency features.
