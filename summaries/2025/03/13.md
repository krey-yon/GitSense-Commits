# Activity Summary for 3/13/2025

## 11:36:25 AM
The log shows the development of a simple Go program.  The file `main.go` was repeatedly modified between 10:37 AM and 10:44 AM on March 13, 2025.  Initially, the file was empty.  The code progressively evolved:  a `package main` declaration was added, followed by an empty `main` function, which was then populated with a "Hello, World!" print statement.  Early versions used `println`, later corrected to `fmt.Println`, necessitating the addition of the `import "fmt"` statement.  The final version at 10:44 AM is a correctly formatted and functional "Hello, World!" program in Go.  The pattern is iterative development, with incremental additions and corrections to the code.
