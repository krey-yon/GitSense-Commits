# Activity Summary for 3/19/2025

## 4:29:16 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `trending-page.tsx` and `why-choose-us.tsx` components, with several minor edits to `app\page.tsx`.  The `trending-page.tsx` file underwent significant changes between 3:34 PM and 3:50 PM, primarily focusing on replacing placeholder images with actual meme images and refining background decorative elements.  The initial version used `/placeholder.svg` for background images, which were subsequently replaced with `/image/bgintrendingpage.png`.  Further changes involved adding meme images (`/image/meme1.jpg`, `/image/meme2.jpg`, `/image/meme3.jpg`) to the meme cards and adjustments to the image sizes and aspect ratios within those cards.  The `opacity` of one of the background decorative elements was also adjusted in the final version from 20 to 10 and then back to 20. The `translate-x` and `translate-y` properties of some elements were adjusted in multiple commits.  The heading font was changed to `jaro-regular`.

The `why-choose-us.tsx` file was modified between 3:53 PM and 4:08 PM.  These changes involved altering the background image from `/placeholder.svg` to `/image/bginwhychooseus.png` and adjusting the styling of the cards, changing some `bg-red-500` to `bg-orange-600` and adding `max-w-2xl`, `w-2xs`, `w-xl`, `w-3xs` and `translate-x` class names to the card divs for better layout.  Line breaks were added to some paragraphs for improved readability.

Finally, the `app\page.tsx` file was updated at 3:54 PM to import and include the `WhyChooseUs` component, reflecting the addition of a "Why Choose Us" page to the application.  The changes here were concise and straightforward.  The overall pattern in the code changes is a focus on visual improvements, replacing placeholders with actual assets and refining styling for a better user experience.
