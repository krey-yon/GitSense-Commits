# Activity Summary for 3/9/2025

## 11:53:11 AM
The log shows development on two React components: `meme-card.tsx` and `meme-modal.tsx`.  The `meme-card.tsx` component displays individual meme cards, incorporating features like liking, commenting, and sharing.  Significant changes to `meme-card.tsx` occurred between 10:55 AM and 11:20 AM, focusing on implementing optimistic updates for like counts using React's `useOptimistic` and `useTransition` hooks.  The initial versions contained commented-out code for liking using local storage, which was replaced by the optimistic update approach.  Finally, a `CommentModal` component was added at 11:06 AM, and its integration with `meme-card.tsx` was refined by making it open when the comments button is clicked at 11:09:53 AM.


The `meme-modal.tsx` component is a modal for viewing and adding comments to a meme.  Initially, it contained sample comment data. The most substantial modifications to `meme-modal.tsx` happened between 11:01 AM and 11:52 AM.  These changes involved adding a `Dialog` component to create the modal functionality,  refining the type definitions for props `open` and `setOpen` and properly handling those as props at 11:03:33 AM, integrating the `optimisticState` prop to display the updated like count from the meme card, and incorporating  `getComments` and `addComments` functions from the `@/actions/meme` module to fetch and post comments.  The initial placeholder comment data was removed at 11:38:56 AM, making the component fully dynamic and data-driven, and the `fetchComments` function was added at 11:40:05 AM  to initially populate the comments, replacing hardcoded values. The final version uses a more streamlined and efficient method for data handling and removes unnecessary imports like  `auth` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`.  Throughout these changes, the styling remained largely consistent, primarily using Tailwind CSS classes.
