# Activity Summary for 3/15/2025

## 9:30:45 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\t3arena\src\app\waiting-room\page.tsx`, a React component for a Tic-Tac-Toe waiting room.

The initial version (8:34:25 AM) implemented a visually appealing waiting room with animations using `framer-motion`.  It displays the game status,  a placeholder (`CreatingGameSkeleton`) while waiting for a game, and the player's symbol once assigned. A game ID is shown and a copy button is implemented.

The next update (8:34:31 AM) introduced a significantly simpler version of the component. This version used a WebSocket connection (`ws://localhost:3001`) to manage the game status, obtaining the game ID and player symbol from the server, and redirecting on match found.

Subsequent changes (8:39:17 AM, 8:39:29 AM, 8:39:40 AM, 8:39:48 AM) progressively merged the features of the first two versions. The final version (8:47:24 AM) combines the enhanced UI from the first version with the WebSocket functionality of the second.  The copyGameId button was removed in one of the intermediate steps (8:39:29 AM) and was not reinstated later. The  `lucide-react` import was corrected. The component now displays a visually rich waiting room experience while handling WebSocket communication for matchmaking.  The styling extensively uses Tailwind CSS classes.  The final version also included a change from `min-h-screen` to `min-h-screen w-full` in the main div.

A recurring theme is the use of animations (`framer-motion`) to create a visually engaging user experience, and the use of loading indicators while waiting for a connection or an opponent.  The WebSocket connection is consistently updated throughout the revisions, demonstrating an iterative development process focused on adding features while maintaining core functionality.


## 3:10:12 PM
The log shows two edits to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\t3arena\src\app\layout.tsx`.  The changes between the two commits (2:10:37 PM and 2:10:50 PM) are minimal and insignificant.  The only difference is the removal of a space before the closing `>` tag within the `<body>` element.  Both versions import Google fonts (`Geist` and `Geist_Mono`), define metadata for a Next.js app, and render children within a basic HTML structure.  The code consistently uses these fonts and sets up a basic page layout.  There are no other significant changes to report based on the provided data.
