# Activity Summary for 3/2/2025

## 12:18:35 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `api.ts` within a short timeframe (between 11:54 AM and 11:59 AM on March 2nd, 2025).  The file contains a function `getMemes` that fetches meme posts using Prisma.

The primary changes revolve around the `prisma.post.findMany` query within the `getMemes` function.

* **11:54 AM:** The initial version lacks an `orderBy` clause and `include` parameter, resulting in potentially unordered results and missing author data.

* **11:56 AM:** An `orderBy` clause is added (`orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" }`), sorting posts by creation date in descending order.  An empty `include` object is also added, though it's not yet functional.

* **11:56:40 AM:** The `include` parameter is corrected to `include: { author: true, }`, ensuring that author information is included in the fetched data.

* **11:59 AM - 11:59:52 AM:**  These two commits show attempts to fix a typo in the `likesCount` field within the `map` function. The final version remains incomplete, with `post.` as the last part of `likesCount: post.` suggesting an unfinished correction.

In summary, the key development is the refinement of the data fetching within the `getMemes` function.  The changes introduce proper ordering and author data inclusion, improving the functionality. The final commit shows a minor, incomplete error that needs to be resolved (likely adding `.likes` to `post.likes` in the `likesCount` line).
