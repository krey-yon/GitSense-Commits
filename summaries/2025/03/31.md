# Activity Summary for 3/31/2025

## 8:20:04 PM
The log shows modifications to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\Learning new stuff\turborepo\apps\web\app\page.tsx`.  The first entry (7:27:38 PM) contains a Next.js component rendering a page with a logo, instructions, links to Vercel and Turbo documentation, and buttons. The second entry (7:28:27 PM), made only one minute later, completely overwrites the content of the file, replacing it with a single empty `div`. This suggests a significant, potentially accidental, change to the page's content.  The pattern shows a quick transition from a complex component to an empty one, indicating a possible rollback or unintended deletion.
