# Activity Summary for 3/14/2025

## 2:19:00 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a Tic-Tac-Toe game project ("t3arena").  The changes span from March 14th, 2025, between approximately 1:19 PM and 1:54 PM.

The `.gitignore` file was updated at 1:19:09 PM,  defining which files and directories should be excluded from version control.  This includes standard items like `node_modules`, build artifacts, and environment files.


The `tsconfig.json` file underwent two modifications (1:19:39 PM and 1:19:48 PM).  The primary change was the addition of `"rootDir": "./src"` in the second update, specifying the root directory for source files.  Numerous compiler options were commented out, suggesting a streamlining or initial setup of the TypeScript configuration.


The `src/index.ts` file, the backend entry point, saw updates to its message (from "Hello World!" to "API is running") and a change from a `require` to an `import` statement for the `express` library (between 1:21:15 PM and 1:22:09 PM), indicating a shift to ES modules.

The `src/app/page.tsx` file (the frontend dashboard) experienced several revisions (between 1:24:20 PM and 1:25:30 PM). The major modification involved adding  `{/* eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element */}` to suppress a linter warning related to using `<img>` elements. This suggests that the image imports were causing a linting issue that was resolved by temporarily disabling the rule.  There were no functional changes to the UI.


The `src/app/waiting-room/page.tsx` file, responsible for the waiting room UI, was updated twice (between 1:27:27 PM and 1:28:47 PM).  The changes were minor, primarily correcting a typographical error changing "You'll" to "You&apos;ll"  to avoid rendering problems with the apostrophe.


The `src/components/tic-tac-toe-board.tsx` file, which contains the game logic, was updated at 1:29:19 PM. This file displays the core Tic-Tac-Toe game logic.


The `src/app/practice/page.tsx` file (the practice mode page) underwent several modifications (between 1:45:35 PM and 1:47:43 PM). These changes seem to focus on UI refinements and enhancements to the game flow and feedback, specifically around the presentation of game status, turn information, and play-again functionality.  The file was also cleaned up by removing unused imports.

The `src/components/player-info.tsx` file was modified at 1:46:26 PM and 1:54:14 PM. The changes involved updating the avatar image source for the opponent, replacing a placeholder SVG with a specific image path ("/image/robot-avatar-circle-icon.jpg").


The `src/app/game/page.tsx` file (the game page) had several revisions (between 1:49:23 PM and 1:49:45 PM), focusing primarily on UI improvements and more robust handling of the game state and user feedback to improve user experience. The final commit included fixes to the apostrophe, similar to the waiting room page.


In summary, the log reflects iterative development with a focus on UI enhancements and bug fixes related to linting, rendering and user experience alongside backend setup and small adjustments to the game's logic.  The majority of the changes concentrate on the frontend components, with only minor alterations in the backend and configuration files.


## 4:18:59 PM
The log shows development of a backend for a tic-tac-toe game using Express.js and WebSockets.

The earliest changes (3/14/2025, 3:21 PM) involve creating a function `generateRoomCode` to generate random 6-character alphanumeric room codes.  No changes were made to this function's functionality after its initial creation.

Between 3:21 PM and 3:22 PM, the `package.json` file was updated multiple times to add build and start scripts for a TypeScript project using Express.js.  Specifically, the `scripts` section was modified to include "build" (using `tsc -b`), "start" (running the built code), and a "dev" script chaining build and start.

From 3:24 PM to 3:38 PM, the `src/index.ts` file underwent significant changes.  Initially a simple Express.js server, it evolved to incorporate WebSockets using the `ws` library, for handling real-time game logic.  A `WebSocket.Server` was added, listening on port 8080 initially and later integrated with the existing Express.js server using `http.createServer`.  The code then implemented functionality for managing waiting players in a queue (`waitingPlayers` array) and active games using a `Map` (`games`).  The WebSocket server listens for 'joinWaitingRoom' messages, matches players, creates games with unique IDs using `generateRoomCode`, and notifies players of their match status.   The handling of player disconnections was also added, removing them from the waiting queue.  Finally, the type definitions were added and some minor syntax corrections were done.  Importantly, a `makeMove` handler was added at 4:04 PM and refined to allow for real-time game updates.  The code transitioned from using `app.listen` to `server.listen` for the main server.

Around 3:37 PM, the `generateRoomCode` function was imported into `src/index.ts`, enabling the use of unique game IDs.

The final significant change (4:08 PM) updated the server port to 3001.  The final version of `src/index.ts` includes robust handling of WebSocket messages, including a full implementation of the tic-tac-toe game's logic, sending game updates, and handling errors.  The code uses consistent casing and structuring.
