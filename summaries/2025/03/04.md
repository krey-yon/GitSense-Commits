# Activity Summary for 3/4/2025

## 3:39:06 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `meme-explorer.tsx` between 2:41 AM and 3:16 AM on March 4, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying a meme explorer interface.  The primary functionality involves fetching and displaying memes, allowing users to filter by category (trending, new, classic, random), sort by (likes, date, comments), and search.

Initial versions of the code included URL parameter handling using `useRouter` and `useSearchParams` to maintain filter state across navigation.  This functionality was subsequently removed in later commits (around 3:00 AM).  A debounced search function using `lodash`'s `debounce` ensures efficient search updates.  The code utilizes infinite scrolling with an `IntersectionObserver`.  This feature was also removed later (around 3:08 AM).  The `getMemes` function from `@/lib/api` fetches meme data.

The `MemeGrid` component, introduced at 3:09 AM, renders the fetched memes.  The `MemeCard` component (introduced at 3:12 AM) displays individual memes, allowing users to like, comment (though functionality isn't shown), and share.  Initially, the like count was updated client-side only; API interaction for actual liking is noted as a TODO.  Minor styling changes were made to the `MemeCard` component's card footer (changes to background color). The final version of `meme-explorer.tsx` simplifies the code by removing the unnecessary URL parameter updating and infinite scrolling features, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.  The overall structure and functionality of the component remain consistent throughout the edit history.  The majority of changes were focused on refining the code's logic and efficiency.
