# Activity Summary for 3/6/2025

## 6:53:37 PM
The log shows iterative development of `meme-card.tsx` and `meme-grid.tsx` components.  Initially, `meme-card.tsx`  was heavily commented-out, suggesting a refactoring or cleanup process.  Between 5:55 PM and 5:59 PM, the `meme-card.tsx` component underwent several minor changes, primarily involving debugging (`console.log` statements added and modified to log `memesData`, `meme.likesCount`, and `meme.liked`).  The final version of `meme-card.tsx` (around 6:37 PM)  uses local state (`liked`, `likesCount`, `isLoading`) managed with `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.  Crucially, it introduced local storage to persist like counts and liked status across sessions, and implemented optimistic updates for the like button, reflecting changes before server confirmation.  Error handling with a `try...catch...finally` block was also added for robustness.  The `likeMeme` function from `@/lib/api` is used to handle like interactions.

`meme-grid.tsx` initially included a `handleLike` function to manage likes, utilizing the `likeMeme` API function and updating its `memesData` state accordingly.  However, by 6:09 PM, this `handleLike` function was completely removed from `meme-grid.tsx`,  likely to be handled directly in the child `meme-card` component. The component renders a grid of meme cards using `memes.map`.  A later edit (6:07 PM) added a `console.log` to check the result of `likeMeme`, suggesting more debugging.  The final version removed the unnecessary `handleLike` function.  The grid structure remains consistent throughout the changes with responsive design elements.

The overall pattern reveals a progression from a possibly initial implementation, through iterative debugging and enhancement to a final, more polished component using local storage and optimistic updates for enhanced user experience.  The primary focus was on creating a reliable and efficient like functionality in both components.
