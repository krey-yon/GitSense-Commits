# Activity Summary for 3/21/2025

## 3:24:47 PM
The log shows updates to two files within the `Memeverse` project on March 21, 2025.

The file `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Memeverse\src\app\user-memes\page.tsx` was updated at 2:25:54 PM. This component renders a grid of memes fetched using the `useFetchMemes` hook.  It displays a "No memes found" message if no memes are found and a loading indicator (`Loader2`) while fetching.

The file `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Memeverse\src\components\Navbar.tsx`  underwent two updates:

* **2:29:47 PM:** The initial commit of the Navbar component.  This component is a responsive navigation bar including links to "Create Memes," "Explore," "About us," and "Leaderboard" pages.  It uses Clerk.js for user authentication, showing either a `UserButton` if signed in or a "Sign in" button otherwise.  The component uses a hamburger menu for smaller screens.

* **2:29:55 PM:** A minor update to the Navbar component at 2:29:55 PM.  The only change is a correction in the `href` attribute of the "About us" link in the mobile menu, changing from `/` to `/about-us`.  All other aspects of the component remain unchanged.

Both components utilize Next.js features (`Link`, `Image`, `useRouter`) and custom styling.  The Navbar consistently employs the `jaro-regular` font class.  There's a minor stylistic inconsistency between the desktop and mobile versions of the "About Us" link before the correction.
