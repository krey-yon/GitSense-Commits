# Activity Summary for 3/21/2025

## 3:24:47 PM
The log shows updates to two files within the `Memeverse` project on March 21, 2025.

The file `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Memeverse\src\app\user-memes\page.tsx` was updated at 2:25:54 PM. This component renders a grid of memes fetched using the `useFetchMemes` hook.  It displays a "No memes found" message if no memes are found and a loading indicator (`Loader2`) while fetching.

The file `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Memeverse\src\components\Navbar.tsx`  underwent two updates:

* **2:29:47 PM:** The initial commit of the Navbar component.  This component is a responsive navigation bar including links to "Create Memes," "Explore," "About us," and "Leaderboard" pages.  It uses Clerk.js for user authentication, showing either a `UserButton` if signed in or a "Sign in" button otherwise.  The component uses a hamburger menu for smaller screens.

* **2:29:55 PM:** A minor update to the Navbar component at 2:29:55 PM.  The only change is a correction in the `href` attribute of the "About us" link in the mobile menu, changing from `/` to `/about-us`.  All other aspects of the component remain unchanged.

Both components utilize Next.js features (`Link`, `Image`, `useRouter`) and custom styling.  The Navbar consistently employs the `jaro-regular` font class.  There's a minor stylistic inconsistency between the desktop and mobile versions of the "About Us" link before the correction.


## 4:51:53 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `GameContent.tsx` and `playagainbutton.tsx` components between 3:58 PM and 4:51 PM on March 21, 2025.  The `GameContent.tsx` component, a React component rendering a Tic-Tac-Toe game, underwent multiple revisions focusing primarily on WebSocket handling and UI improvements. Initially, the `Play Again` button within `GameContent.tsx` handled navigation directly.  Later, a separate `playagainbutton.tsx` component was created and refined. This new component improved the handling of the WebSocket connection before navigating to the `/waiting-room` route, implementing more robust error handling, and eventually simplifying the navigation logic entirely. The initial implementation of `playagainbutton.tsx`  was very basic, evolving to include styling and the  `framer-motion` library for animations.  The  `.env` file was updated twice, first setting the backend URL to `wss://api.kreyon.in`, and later changing it to `http://localhost:3001`, indicating a switch between a production and development environment.  The final version of `GameContent.tsx` removed the conditional rendering of the `PlayAgainButton` component, rendering the button irrespective of game state.  In `playagainbutton.tsx`, the  `handlePlayAgain` function initially performed both socket closing and routing using  `window.location.href` and `router.push`, and then  changed to send a "playAgain" message via the socket before any navigation occurs.  Ultimately, this message is sent, and the routing logic is removed completely.  The  `PlayAgainButton` component's props were simplified, removing the unnecessary props `winner`, `isDraw`, and `opponentDisconnected`.
