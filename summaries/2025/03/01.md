# Activity Summary for 3/1/2025

## 2:17:58 AM
The log shows development on a meme upload feature.  The `route.ts` file, responsible for handling image uploads to Cloudinary, underwent several revisions between 1:18 AM and 1:32 AM on March 1st, 2025.  Initially, authentication was included, then removed,  and finally the code stabilized. The upload folder was changed from `"nextjs-cloudinary"` to `"memeverse"`. The most significant change was correcting the response to return the `secure_url` instead of `public_id` or `sec` at approximately 1:32 AM.

The `meme-uploadpage.tsx` file, which provides the user interface for meme uploading, saw updates between 1:22 AM and 1:54 AM on March 1st, 2025.  Changes focused primarily on the `uploadToCloudinary` function.  Initially, metadata was sent as a JSON object within the FormData. This was later changed at approximately 1:47 AM to a simpler string format (`caption=${caption}|position=${position}|...`), likely for compatibility with Cloudinary's upload parameters.  The `upload_preset` was removed from the formData at approximately 1:52 AM.  The overall UI remained largely consistent, with improvements to caption formatting and progress display.  The frequent commits to both files around 1:22 -1:32 AM and 1:47 AM suggest focused development bursts on integrating the upload functionality.
