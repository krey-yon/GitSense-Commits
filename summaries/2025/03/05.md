# Activity Summary for 3/5/2025

## 12:22:25 AM
The log shows development of a meme viewing and liking application.  Significant changes happened between 11:37 PM and 12:20 AM.

`meme-card.tsx` (3/4/2025, 11:37 PM & 3/4/2025, 11:57 PM & 3/4/2025, 11:58 PM & 3/4/2025, 11:58 PM): This component renders individual meme cards.  Initial version included basic display of meme data. A later update added `memeId` prop to the `MemeCardProps` interface and to the component's parameters, likely for unique meme identification.  A final update added a `console.log(memeId)` statement within the `handleLike` function, suggesting debugging or preparation for backend interaction.

`meme-explorer.tsx` (3/4/2025, 11:52 PM, 3/4/2025, 11:55 PM, 3/4/2025, 11:55 PM, 3/4/2025, 11:56 PM): This component displays a grid of memes, allowing users to filter and sort them. Multiple edits were made to this file within a short time span.  The first changes involved removing unused state `memeId` and adding a `console.log(memes)` statement (later removed) for debugging purposes.  The component handles searching, filtering by category ("trending," "new," "classic," "random"), and sorting ("likes," "date," "comments"). The pagination logic is implemented using `page` and `hasMore` states.

`meme-grid.tsx` (3/4/2025, 11:58 PM & 3/5/2025, 12:00 AM & 3/5/2025, 12:00 AM):  This component renders the grid of memes using `MemeCard` components.  Initial version correctly passed `memeId` only for the last meme in the array. Minor updates fixed inconsistencies in passing `memeId` to the `MemeCard` component, ensuring all memes received a unique identifier.

`app/api/likes/route.ts` (3/5/2025, 12:13 AM - 3/5/2025, 12:20 AM): This API route handles liking and unliking memes.  The file underwent extensive revisions.  Initial versions were incomplete function definitions. The final version uses the `POST` method, extracts `userId` and `memeId` from the request body, checks for existing likes using Prisma ORM, and handles both liking (creating a new like) and unliking (deleting an existing like) with appropriate HTTP status codes.  Error handling is also included.


The overall pattern shows iterative development focusing on a meme-viewing application's frontend and backend components.  The rapid changes in `meme-explorer.tsx` and `app/api/likes/route.ts` suggest debugging and refinement of the API interaction and data handling.  The changes to `meme-grid.tsx` and `meme-card.tsx` demonstrate attention to detail in the frontend UI.
