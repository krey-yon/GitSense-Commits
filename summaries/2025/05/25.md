# Activity Summary for 5/25/2025

## 8:10:25 PM
On May 25th, 2025, at 7:40:07 PM, the `requirements.txt` file within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` backend's docker directory was updated.  The update lists several Python packages and their versions, including Flask, sling, PyYAML, Werkzeug, flask-cors, simple-salesforce, pandas, boto3, and pymongo.  This suggests a dependency update for the backend application, potentially involving web framework components (Flask, Werkzeug), data handling (pandas, pymongo), cloud services (boto3), and potentially Salesforce integration (simple-salesforce). The lack of version numbers for some packages (`flask-cors`) indicates that the latest available version was likely used.
