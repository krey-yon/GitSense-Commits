# Activity Summary for 5/25/2025

## 8:10:25 PM
On May 25th, 2025, at 7:40:07 PM, the `requirements.txt` file within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` backend's docker directory was updated.  The update lists several Python packages and their versions, including Flask, sling, PyYAML, Werkzeug, flask-cors, simple-salesforce, pandas, boto3, and pymongo.  This suggests a dependency update for the backend application, potentially involving web framework components (Flask, Werkzeug), data handling (pandas, pymongo), cloud services (boto3), and potentially Salesforce integration (simple-salesforce). The lack of version numbers for some packages (`flask-cors`) indicates that the latest available version was likely used.


## 9:10:31 PM
The log shows several code changes across different files within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` project.  The most significant changes relate to authentication and data pipeline setup.

**c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts (5/25/2025, 8:12:25 PM):** This file handles the Salesforce OAuth callback.  The authentication check has been removed.  The code exchanges the authorization code for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL from Salesforce. It then stores these tokens in cookies (`sf_access_token`, `sf_refresh_token`, `sf_instance_url`) and  attempts to upsert the data (user ID, organization ID, access token, instance URL, refresh token) into a `autonmis_api_providers_table` database.  However, the actual database upsert operation is commented out.  The response includes a simple HTML page confirming connection status, which uses `postMessage` to communicate with the parent window.  Error handling is implemented to display appropriate messages to the user based on success or failure.

**c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\components\dbconnection.tsx (5/25/2025, 8:12:34 PM):**  This React component handles database connection configuration. It supports various data sources (Salesforce, Hubspot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, Airtable, and Mixpanel). The component manages the connection status (testing, established, disconnecting) and handles authentication for API connections.  It polls the API to verify connection status after connecting.  A `getAuthURL` function constructs OAuth URLs for different applications, retrieving client IDs and redirect URIs from environment variables or hardcoded fallbacks. The `saveAndNext` function submits the form data (including API tokens if applicable).  Error handling is also implemented, validating form fields before submission. The connection testing logic differentiates between API and database connections.  Note that there's a placeholder `userId` and the actual database interactions (save and next step logic) are omitted.

**c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\backend\docker\app.py (5/25/2025, 8:47:59 PM):** A simple Flask application that returns "Hello from Flask!"  This likely serves as a basic backend for the application.

**c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\backend\docker\Dockerfile (5/25/2025, 8:54:28 PM and 5/25/2025, 8:57:13 PM):** This Dockerfile builds a Python 3.9 application using a slim base image. It installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`, copies the application code, exposes port 5001, sets the `FLASK_APP` environment variable, and runs the Flask application. Two nearly identical versions exist, differing only by the presence of an extra `RUN ls` command in the earlier version.

**c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\backend\docker\docker-compose.yml (5/25/2025, 9:04:54 PM):** This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container setup including a PostgreSQL database, Redis server,  and multiple Airflow services (webserver, scheduler, worker, triggerer). It configures various Airflow settings and uses health checks to monitor the services.  A `flask-app` service is also defined, which likely links to the `app.py` file.  The configuration heavily uses environment variables.


In summary, the changes demonstrate work on a data pipeline system that uses OAuth to integrate with several third-party APIs (Salesforce, Hubspot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, Airtable, and Mixpanel).  The backend is a simple Flask app containerized within a larger Airflow environment.  The frontend component handles user interaction, connection management, and data submission. A noticeable pattern is the extensive use of environment variables (though values are not shown in the log due to safety precautions) and a consistent approach to error handling and user feedback.  The commented-out code suggests ongoing development and potential changes to data storage strategy.
