# Activity Summary for 5/15/2025

## 1:26:48 PM
The log shows development activity on a React application.  The `App.tsx` file underwent two significant changes on May 15th, 2025, between 12:29 PM and 12:29 PM.  The first revision included React imports and state management using `useState`, which were subsequently removed in the second revision.  The second revision simplified the component to a basic `<main>` element.  A new component, `HeroPage.tsx`, was created at 1:25 PM on the same day, rendering a simple "HeroPage" div.  The overall pattern suggests initial experimentation with state and component structure in `App.tsx`, followed by simplification and the addition of a new component.
