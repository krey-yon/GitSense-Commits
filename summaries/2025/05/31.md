# Activity Summary for 5/31/2025

## 7:38:21 PM
The log shows development of a command-line PDF chatbot named Cliven.  The `cliven.py` file underwent the most significant changes, evolving over several commits between 6:38 PM and 7:22 PM on May 31st, 2025.

**`cliven.py` Changes:**

Early versions focused on core functionality:  ingesting PDFs (parsing, embedding, storing in ChromaDB),  interactive chat (with existing docs or newly ingested ones), and basic commands (list, delete, clear).  The `handle_ingest` function is noteworthy for its comprehensive PDF processing pipeline using `rich` for progress indicators and detailed output.  Error handling and user feedback are integrated throughout.

Later commits introduced:

* **Model selection:**  The ability to specify or auto-select the best available Ollama model (`tinyllama:chat` preferred, then `mistral:7b`).  This involved adding `get_available_models` and `select_best_available_model` functions which interact with a Dockerized Ollama instance via `subprocess`.
* **Docker management:** The addition of the `handle_docker` function greatly enhances the tool by automating the startup and management of Docker services (ChromaDB and Ollama).  It includes robust error checking and user guidance for Docker setup.


**`setup.py` Changes:**

Minor version updates were made to the project's metadata (version 0.1.0 to 0.1.1). No functional changes were made in the setup file.

**`chat.py` Changes:**

This file, introduced at 7:22 PM, handles the chat engine logic. It leverages Ollama for LLM inference and ChromaDB for vector search. It has a sophisticated prompt engineering mechanism to tailor prompts based on the model used, improves error handling, and includes functions to get and display available Ollama models and status.


**`README.md` Changes:**

The README file was updated to reflect the added features, particularly the Docker integration and model selection options.  The improvements to the documentation  highlight the improved user experience.  The documentation also includes instructions for using a better performance model by passing the `--better-performance` flag.


**Recurring Elements:**

The consistent use of `localhost` for local development across different functions indicates a focus on ease of local setup and testing.  The extensive use of logging and informative console output suggests a commitment to clear user feedback and debugging.  The implementation consistently prioritizes error handling and graceful degradation.
