# Activity Summary for 5/31/2025

## 7:38:21 PM
The log shows development of a command-line PDF chatbot named Cliven.  The `cliven.py` file underwent the most significant changes, evolving over several commits between 6:38 PM and 7:22 PM on May 31st, 2025.

**`cliven.py` Changes:**

Early versions focused on core functionality:  ingesting PDFs (parsing, embedding, storing in ChromaDB),  interactive chat (with existing docs or newly ingested ones), and basic commands (list, delete, clear).  The `handle_ingest` function is noteworthy for its comprehensive PDF processing pipeline using `rich` for progress indicators and detailed output.  Error handling and user feedback are integrated throughout.

Later commits introduced:

* **Model selection:**  The ability to specify or auto-select the best available Ollama model (`tinyllama:chat` preferred, then `mistral:7b`).  This involved adding `get_available_models` and `select_best_available_model` functions which interact with a Dockerized Ollama instance via `subprocess`.
* **Docker management:** The addition of the `handle_docker` function greatly enhances the tool by automating the startup and management of Docker services (ChromaDB and Ollama).  It includes robust error checking and user guidance for Docker setup.


**`setup.py` Changes:**

Minor version updates were made to the project's metadata (version 0.1.0 to 0.1.1). No functional changes were made in the setup file.

**`chat.py` Changes:**

This file, introduced at 7:22 PM, handles the chat engine logic. It leverages Ollama for LLM inference and ChromaDB for vector search. It has a sophisticated prompt engineering mechanism to tailor prompts based on the model used, improves error handling, and includes functions to get and display available Ollama models and status.


**`README.md` Changes:**

The README file was updated to reflect the added features, particularly the Docker integration and model selection options.  The improvements to the documentation  highlight the improved user experience.  The documentation also includes instructions for using a better performance model by passing the `--better-performance` flag.


**Recurring Elements:**

The consistent use of `localhost` for local development across different functions indicates a focus on ease of local setup and testing.  The extensive use of logging and informative console output suggests a commitment to clear user feedback and debugging.  The implementation consistently prioritizes error handling and graceful degradation.


## 8:38:15 PM
The log shows updates to two files on May 31, 2025.

The `cliven.py` file (7:41:18 PM) contains the main Python code for a CLI application named "Cliven," designed to interact with PDF documents.  The code includes functions for:

*   **Ingesting PDFs:**  This involves parsing, chunking, embedding, and storing PDF content in a ChromaDB vector database.  The process uses progress indicators for better user experience. Error handling is included at each step.
*   **Interactive Chat:** This allows users to ask questions about the ingested PDFs.  It uses an Ollama model (selection logic is built in to handle multiple models) for the chat functionality, and includes quiet mode to suppress verbose logs during the chat session.
*   **Document Management:** Functions for listing, deleting, and clearing processed documents are also present.
*   **Docker Management:** The code handles starting and managing Docker services (ChromaDB and Ollama) using `docker-compose`. It checks for Docker daemon status and handles various potential errors.  It offers an option to choose between a "better performance" model (`mistral:7b`) and a "lightweight model" (`tinyllama:chat`).

The `docker-compose.yml` file (7:58:59 PM) defines the configuration for the Docker containers used by Cliven.  It specifies the use of the `chromadb/chroma:latest` image for a ChromaDB server and the `ollama/ollama:latest` image for an Ollama server, both connected via a `cliven-network` bridge.  Port mappings are defined for external access to both services.


The most significant change is the addition of the complete `cliven.py` application code, which implements the PDF processing, chat interaction, and Docker management features at 7:41:18 PM. The `docker-compose.yml` update at 7:58:59 PM seems to be a configuration adjustment for the application's Docker setup, likely made after or in conjunction with the primary code update.  There is no indication of recurring elements beyond the use of logging and progress indicators within the Python code.


## 9:38:16 PM
The log shows development of a CLI application named Cliven,  which interacts with PDF documents.  Key changes span several files and functionalities.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\cliven\docker-compose.yml`**: This file defines the Docker Compose configuration.  Two services are defined: `chromadb` (using the `chromadb/chroma:latest` image, port 8000) and `ollama` (using `ollama/ollama:latest`, port 11434). Both services share the `cliven-network`.  The file was modified twice, at 8:42:59 PM and 9:13:56 PM, with the second modification seemingly removing the `version: "3.8"` line, suggesting a simplification or potential migration.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\cliven\utils\parser.py`**: This file contains Python code for parsing PDF files using `pdfplumber` and Langchain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.  The code extracts text from PDFs, splits the text into chunks with metadata (including chunk ID, size, and source file information), and handles exceptions with logging.  This file was updated at 8:54:50 PM.  The functions (`extract_text_from_pdf`, `chunk_text`, `parse_pdf_with_chunking`, `preview_chunks`) indicate a well-structured approach to PDF processing and chunking for efficient embedding and querying.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\cliven\main\cliven.py`**: This is the main CLI application file, updated at 9:10:31 PM. It uses `argparse` for command-line argument handling and provides commands for ingesting PDFs (`ingest`), interactive chat (`chat`), listing processed documents (`list`), deleting documents (`delete`), clearing documents (`clear`), checking system status (`status`), and displaying help/version information.  The code interacts with other modules (`utils.parser`, `utils.embedder`, `utils.vectordb`) and manages the interactive chat loop. It also includes functions for managing Docker services and handling different Ollama language models (favoring `gemma2:2b` and `gemma3:4b`).  The inclusion of a progress indicator using `rich` library enhances the user experience during PDF processing.  The error handling and logging throughout the code demonstrate a robust design.
