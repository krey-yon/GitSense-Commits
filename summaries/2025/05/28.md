# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 11:10:04 AM
The provided log is incomplete; it shows a file path and timestamp but lacks the actual code content for `salesforce_dag.py`.  Therefore, a meaningful summary of code changes is impossible.  To create a summary, please provide the code content for the listed file path and any additional files mentioned in the log.  A complete log will allow for analysis of modifications, identification of key changes (e.g., additions, deletions, modifications to specific functions or classes), and the detection of patterns or recurring elements within the codebase.

The log shows a series of modifications to the `route.ts` file,  primarily focused on the POST and GET request handlers for managing extraction configurations using a Supabase database.

The initial versions (12:03:20 PM and 12:03:39 PM)  include authentication checks (`supabase.auth.getUser()`), which were later commented out (12:03:55 PM, 12:04:05 PM, 12:04:14 PM, 12:04:39 PM, 12:05:51 PM, 12:05:58 PM).  Around 12:06 PM, the `request.body()` method used for extracting data from the request was also commented out.  The user ID was hardcoded to "111"  (12:04:05 PM onwards) instead of fetching it from authentication data. Then from 12:07 PM onwards, attempts were made to hardcode the `pipeline_id` to "123" within the `insert` method, which eventually resulted in removing most of the `insert` parameters (12:08:08 PM and 12:08:16 PM). Finally, at 12:09:07 PM, the authentication checks were restored, reverting the file to a state similar to the initial version, but this time using `request.json()` instead of `request.body()` to parse the request.

Throughout the modifications,  the core functionality of interacting with the `autonomis_bapps_extraction_config` table in Supabase remained consistent.  The changes focused mainly on authentication and data input handling.  The frequent commenting out and uncommenting suggest an iterative debugging process.  The hardcoding of user ID and pipeline ID might indicate testing or bypassing authentication for development purposes. The change from `request.body()` to `request.json()` at the end might reflect a correction in data handling for the POST request.
