# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 11:10:04 AM
The provided log is incomplete; it shows a file path and timestamp but lacks the actual code content for `salesforce_dag.py`.  Therefore, a meaningful summary of code changes is impossible.  To create a summary, please provide the code content for the listed file path and any additional files mentioned in the log.  A complete log will allow for analysis of modifications, identification of key changes (e.g., additions, deletions, modifications to specific functions or classes), and the detection of patterns or recurring elements within the codebase.


## 12:10:06 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `route.ts` file,  primarily focused on the POST and GET request handlers for managing extraction configurations using a Supabase database.

The initial versions (12:03:20 PM and 12:03:39 PM)  include authentication checks (`supabase.auth.getUser()`), which were later commented out (12:03:55 PM, 12:04:05 PM, 12:04:14 PM, 12:04:39 PM, 12:05:51 PM, 12:05:58 PM).  Around 12:06 PM, the `request.body()` method used for extracting data from the request was also commented out.  The user ID was hardcoded to "111"  (12:04:05 PM onwards) instead of fetching it from authentication data. Then from 12:07 PM onwards, attempts were made to hardcode the `pipeline_id` to "123" within the `insert` method, which eventually resulted in removing most of the `insert` parameters (12:08:08 PM and 12:08:16 PM). Finally, at 12:09:07 PM, the authentication checks were restored, reverting the file to a state similar to the initial version, but this time using `request.json()` instead of `request.body()` to parse the request.

Throughout the modifications,  the core functionality of interacting with the `autonomis_bapps_extraction_config` table in Supabase remained consistent.  The changes focused mainly on authentication and data input handling.  The frequent commenting out and uncommenting suggest an iterative debugging process.  The hardcoding of user ID and pipeline ID might indicate testing or bypassing authentication for development purposes. The change from `request.body()` to `request.json()` at the end might reflect a correction in data handling for the POST request.


## 1:10:11 PM
The log shows several code changes across four files within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` application, primarily focusing on data pipeline management and OAuth integrations.

**`route.ts` (5/28/2025, 12:44:56 PM):** This file handles the Salesforce OAuth callback.  Significant changes include removing an unnecessary authentication check and directly interacting with the Salesforce OAuth2 endpoint (`https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`) to exchange authorization codes for access and refresh tokens. The tokens, along with Salesforce organization and user IDs, are then logged (but not yet stored in the database in this revision) and set as cookies (`sf_access_token`, `sf_refresh_token`, `sf_instance_url`). Finally, a simple HTML page confirms successful connection and posts the access and refresh tokens to the opener window using `postMessage`. Error handling is implemented to display appropriate messages to the user.  The CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET are hardcoded within the file.

**`dbconnection.tsx` (5/28/2025, 12:45:03 PM):** This React component manages database connections.  It features functionality to test and manage connections to various data sources (including APIs and databases).  It uses a polling mechanism (`pollTestApiConnection`) to check API connection status after initial connection attempts. The component handles different data source types, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, and Airtable.  It fetches connection details from the database based on the selected data source (`getDataSourceDetail`).  OAuth URLs for various providers are dynamically generated based on environment variables (where available,  else fallbacks are used). The code shows an extensive handling of different authentication methods and scenarios across the mentioned providers, and uses `react-hot-toast` for user notifications.


**`query.ts` (5/28/2025, 1:02:12 PM - 1:03:51 PM):** This file contains multiple Supabase database interaction functions. There are multiple revisions of this file in the log; however, the changes appear minor, focusing on updating logging statements within the `createPipelineServer` function.  The core functionality remains the same throughout the revisions:  functions to retrieve and manipulate data related to flow projects, notebooks, edge functions, workflows, and data sources. The functions use Supabase client to interact with various tables like `autonomis_user_flow_projectv2`, `autonomis_user_py_notebook`, `autonomis_user_edge_functions`, `autonomis_user_workflow`, `autonomis_user_datasource`, and `autonomis_data_source`. The changes to logging show a minor improvement in clarity by explicitly labeling the logged pipeline data.


**`usePipelineActions.ts` (5/28/2025, 1:03:01 PM - 1:03:51 PM):** This file provides custom React hooks for pipeline actions (create and delete).  Multiple revisions of this file also exhibit minor changes, adding logging statements and refining error handling.  The `createPipeline` function handles creating pipelines with PostgreSQL sources and targets. The `createPipelineSling` function is significantly larger and deals with creating pipelines for various source and target types, including file-based systems (S3, GCS, Azure) and different APIs(Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4, Airtable), adjusting the target file name when in 'full-refresh' mode. The function uses `createAirflowVariables` (not shown in log) for interacting with Airflow, dynamically constructing URLs depending on the data source type (`createDatabaseUrl`).  The code exhibits good error handling and uses `react-hot-toast` for feedback.  The `deletePipeline` function offers robust handling of deletion across different pipeline types, including workflows, edge functions, SQL notebooks, and reports, using corresponding functions from `query.ts`.


In summary, the code changes reflect ongoing development related to enhancing the data pipeline creation and management features within the application.  A notable trend is the consistent use of Supabase for database interactions and the progressive addition of support for more diverse data sources and more robust error handling and logging.
