# Activity Summary for 5/13/2025

## 8:37:14 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\app\dashboard\user\orders\page.tsx`  between 7:37 PM and 8:36 PM on May 13, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the implementation of order data retrieval and display using a custom hook (`useQueryData`) for improved data fetching and management.

Initially, the code fetched user details and orders using separate `useEffect` hooks and `getCurrentSession` and `findOrderWithUserId` functions.  Around 7:41 PM, `useRouter` from `next/navigation` was added, enabling page refresh functionality (`router.refresh()`) within the `OrderCard` component, likely to update order status.

Between 7:59 PM and 8:36 PM, the most significant changes were made.  These modifications replaced the initial `useEffect` hooks with `useQueryData` from a custom hook. The `useQueryData` hook is used to fetch both user data (`userData`) using `getCurrentSession` and order data (`orderData`) using `findOrderWithUserId(userData.id)`.  This streamlined the data fetching process.  The  `fetchUserDetails` and `fetchOrdersData`  `useEffect` hooks were removed, replaced by the `useQueryData` calls.  The `userData` type was refined, moving from a nested type definition to a standalone `User` interface. Minor syntax errors and type inconsistencies in `userData`  assignment and usage were also corrected.  Finally, optional chaining (`?.`) was added to  `activeOrders` and `completedOrders` filter operations to handle cases where `orders` might be null.
