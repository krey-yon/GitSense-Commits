# Activity Summary for 5/13/2025

## 8:37:14 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\app\dashboard\user\orders\page.tsx`  between 7:37 PM and 8:36 PM on May 13, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the implementation of order data retrieval and display using a custom hook (`useQueryData`) for improved data fetching and management.

Initially, the code fetched user details and orders using separate `useEffect` hooks and `getCurrentSession` and `findOrderWithUserId` functions.  Around 7:41 PM, `useRouter` from `next/navigation` was added, enabling page refresh functionality (`router.refresh()`) within the `OrderCard` component, likely to update order status.

Between 7:59 PM and 8:36 PM, the most significant changes were made.  These modifications replaced the initial `useEffect` hooks with `useQueryData` from a custom hook. The `useQueryData` hook is used to fetch both user data (`userData`) using `getCurrentSession` and order data (`orderData`) using `findOrderWithUserId(userData.id)`.  This streamlined the data fetching process.  The  `fetchUserDetails` and `fetchOrdersData`  `useEffect` hooks were removed, replaced by the `useQueryData` calls.  The `userData` type was refined, moving from a nested type definition to a standalone `User` interface. Minor syntax errors and type inconsistencies in `userData`  assignment and usage were also corrected.  Finally, optional chaining (`?.`) was added to  `activeOrders` and `completedOrders` filter operations to handle cases where `orders` might be null.


## 9:37:21 PM
The log shows significant code modifications across two files: `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\app\dashboard\user\orders\page.tsx` and `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\pages\user-dashboard.tsx`.  The changes primarily revolve around displaying user orders, categorized as active and completed.

The initial version of `page.tsx` (8:38:15 PM) was a fully functional component displaying user orders fetched using custom hooks (`useQueryData`) and functions from the `actions/order` and `lib/cookie` modules.  The UI uses a tabbed interface from a UI component library (`@/components/ui/*`).  It featured detailed order information, including order items, restaurant ID, status, and delivery address.  The component also included visual indicators for order status and a refresh functionality using `router.refresh()`.

Subsequent modifications to `page.tsx` (between 8:39:08 PM and 8:42:15 PM) involved refactoring, initially reducing the component to an empty return statement and then replacing its functionality by importing and rendering the `OrdersPage` component from `src\pages\user-dashboard.tsx`. This suggests a restructuring of the application's codebase to consolidate order-related logic.


The `user-dashboard.tsx` file (initially at 8:39:01 PM) contains nearly identical code to the initial `page.tsx` version, indicating this was likely the original location of the order display logic.  The file underwent multiple changes between 8:41:08 PM and 8:43:54 PM.  These modifications primarily focused on how order data is received and handled.  The `orderData` prop was added to the `OrdersPage` function which later was changed to receive an array of `Order` objects. The commented-out `useEffect` blocks and commented-out `user` state suggests a transition from direct API calls and fetching user details to relying on react-query's `useQueryData` hook. The `user` state was eventually removed completely in 8:43:35 PM and 8:43:54 PM indicating that user data isn't needed in this component.  In 8:43:54 PM the entire component was commented out.

The final version of `page.tsx` (from 8:58:51 PM onwards) leverages the `useEffect` hook to update the `orders` state whenever `orderData.data` changes.  The `useRouter` hook was removed in 9:03:31 PM, 9:04:01 PM and 9:04:28 PM indicating that the component no longer needs routing capabilities.  The `handleClick` function in `OrderCard` was simplified to remove the `router.refresh()` call.

The `useQueryData` hook in `src\hooks\useQueryData.ts` (8:48:07 PM) is a custom hook designed to streamline the use of `@tanstack/react-query`'s `useQuery` function, making it easier to access data, loading status and refetch the data.


The `src\components\rider-dashboard.tsx` file (from 9:24:11 PM onwards) demonstrates a rider's dashboard which displays orders categorized into "To Pick Up," "In Progress," and "Delivered." It uses similar UI components and leverages custom hooks and functions related to delivery operations. The major change was the introduction of `useQueryData` hook to fetch the orders using react-query which significantly improved the component.


## 10:37:13 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\components\rider-dashboard.tsx` between 9:37 PM and 10:30 PM on May 13, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: a React component displaying a delivery rider's dashboard, showing orders to pick up, in progress, and delivered.  The dashboard uses UI components from a local `@/components/ui` directory and Lucide React icons.  Data fetching is handled by `useQueryData` custom hook, interacting with functions (`checkForNewOrderToPickup`, `riderAcceptedOrders`, `markOrderAsOutForDelivery`, `markOrderAsDelivered`) located in `@/actions/diliveryAgent`.

The initial version (9:37:32 PM) contained commented-out sections suggesting an earlier implementation using `useState` for managing order lists. The subsequent edits focused on improving data refreshing. Specifically:

* **9:37:51 PM:**  `NewOrdersToPickUp.refetch()` was added to the `handlePickup` function to refresh the orders after picking one up.

* **9:37:57 PM:** No code change.

* **9:38:13 PM:** `orderAccepterByRider.refetch()` was added to the `handleDeliver` function to refresh the orders after marking an order delivered.

* **9:40:19 PM - 9:40:56 PM:** These edits involved adding and correcting an import statement for `next/navigation`, ultimately to utilize `useRouter` from that library.  The purpose seems to be to integrate client-side navigation.

* **9:41:12 PM:** The `router = useRouter()` is corrected to `const router = useRouter()`

* **9:43:44 PM:** `router.refresh()` is added to the `handleDeliver` function, likely for improved UI updates after delivery confirmation.

* **10:25:35 PM - 10:30:59 PM:** `router.refresh()` is added to the `handlePickup` function for consistency with the `handleDeliver` function, ensuring the UI is refreshed after picking up an order.  A `console.log(riderOrders)` statement was added, seemingly for debugging purposes.

Throughout the edits, the core UI structure remained largely unchanged. The primary changes revolved around enhancing data synchronization and refreshing the UI after order status updates, utilizing the `refetch` method of `useQueryData` and `router.refresh`.  The commented-out code suggests a shift from a simpler state management strategy to a more sophisticated approach leveraging asynchronous data fetching and a custom hook (`useQueryData`).
