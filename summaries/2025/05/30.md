# Activity Summary for 5/30/2025

## 10:35:07 AM
The log shows initial project setup on May 30th, 2025.  The `requirements.txt` file, updated at 9:39:06 AM, lists Python packages crucial for a likely large language model (LLM) application: `typer`, `rich`, `pdfplumber`, `sentence-transformers`, `chromadb`, `langchain`, and `openai`. This suggests the project involves command-line interface (CLI) development (`typer`), rich text formatting (`rich`), PDF processing (`pdfplumber`), semantic search (`sentence-transformers`, `chromadb`), and LLM integration (`langchain`, `openai`).

The `.gitignore` file, modified shortly after at 9:39:38 AM, defines standard exclusions for version control, including compiled files, virtual environments, temporary files, build artifacts, IDE settings, and importantly, files containing secrets like `.env` and keys (`*.key`).  This demonstrates good practice in protecting sensitive information.


## 1:35:09 PM
The log shows development of a CLI application named `cliven`.  The major changes revolve around the `docker-compose.yml` file and the `cliven.py` file.

**`docker-compose.yml` Changes:**

Two revisions of `docker-compose.yml` are recorded.  The key difference between the two revisions (both on May 30th, 2025, one at 12:59:27 PM and the other at 1:00:11 PM) is the network name. The initial version uses the "chat-pdf-network", which is then changed to "cliven-network" in the subsequent update.  This suggests a refactoring of the network configuration for the application.  Both versions define services for `chromadb` and `ollama`,  configuring them to use Docker images and mapping ports, volumes, and environmental variables. The `cliven-cli` service (or `chat-pdf-cli` in the initial version) is built from the project's local directory (`.`), depends on `chromadb` and `ollama`, and utilizes volumes for PDF input and output.

**`cliven.py` Changes:**

The `cliven.py` file undergoes several revisions between 1:07:40 PM and 1:27:28 PM on May 30th, 2025.  The initial revisions primarily focus on updating the `epilog` in the `ArgumentParser` to point to a different GitHub repository ("https://github.com/krey-yon/cliven" replacing "https://github.com/yourusername/cliven").  The most substantial change occurs in the final revision at 1:27:28 PM.  This update adds functionality for PDF processing and adds error handling to the `ingest` command.  It includes the use of `rich` for progress indication and error reporting,  and introduces `utils.parser` for PDF parsing with chunking.  Importantly, the final version includes placeholder comments (`TODO`) indicating that the actual storage of chunks in ChromaDB is not yet implemented.

**Overall Summary:**

The log documents the development process of a PDF-based chat application. The initial changes focus on setting up the application's Docker environment, while later changes are centered on developing core functionality, specifically PDF ingestion and processing within the application's Python code.  The code improvements demonstrate a focus on user experience (through progress indicators and enhanced error handling) and a move towards integration with a vector database (ChromaDB). The final revision shows the `ingest` functionality is partially complete, with the database storage portion left to be implemented.
