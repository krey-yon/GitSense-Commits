# Activity Summary for 5/30/2025

## 10:35:07 AM
The log shows initial project setup on May 30th, 2025.  The `requirements.txt` file, updated at 9:39:06 AM, lists Python packages crucial for a likely large language model (LLM) application: `typer`, `rich`, `pdfplumber`, `sentence-transformers`, `chromadb`, `langchain`, and `openai`. This suggests the project involves command-line interface (CLI) development (`typer`), rich text formatting (`rich`), PDF processing (`pdfplumber`), semantic search (`sentence-transformers`, `chromadb`), and LLM integration (`langchain`, `openai`).

The `.gitignore` file, modified shortly after at 9:39:38 AM, defines standard exclusions for version control, including compiled files, virtual environments, temporary files, build artifacts, IDE settings, and importantly, files containing secrets like `.env` and keys (`*.key`).  This demonstrates good practice in protecting sensitive information.
