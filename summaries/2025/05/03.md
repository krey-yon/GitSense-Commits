# Activity Summary for 5/3/2025

## 9:00:11 AM
The file `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\app\dashboard\user\restaurant\[id]\page.tsx` underwent a significant update on May 3, 2025, at 8:55:13 AM.  This React component renders a restaurant page displaying menu items, allowing users to add items to an order and place it.

Key changes include:

* **Fetching Restaurant and Menu Data:** The component now uses `useEffect` hooks to asynchronously fetch restaurant information and menu items using `restaurantInfo(id)` and `fetchRestaurantMenu(id)` respectively.  Error handling is included in both fetches. The `id` is obtained from the `params` prop.

* **Order Management:**  The component manages order state (selected items, order status, order ID) using `useState`.  The `handleAddToOrder` function adds menu items to the order, and `handlePlaceOrder` places the order, simulating order status updates (placed, ready, out-for-delivery, delivered) using `setTimeout`. Order status updates are currently mocked and only change local state (using `localStorage` for demonstration).  A real application would require backend integration for persistent order management.

* **UI Components:** The component leverages UI components from `@/components/ui` (Button, Card, Badge, Separator) and Lucide-React icons for visual elements.  Next.js's `Link` and `Image` components are used for navigation and image display.

* **Order Modals:**  The code includes (but comments out) modal components (`OrderModal` and `TrackOrderModal`) for order placement and tracking. The `OrderModal` is functional; the `TrackOrderModal` is not implemented.

* **Data Handling:** The component initially relied on static data (`restaurants`, `menuItems`) from `@/lib/data`, but this was replaced with the dynamic fetching mechanism described above.


The code demonstrates a basic online ordering system with client-side order management;  however, it lacks persistent storage and backend integration for a fully functional application.  The use of `localStorage` is purely for demonstration purposes and should be replaced with a proper backend solution in a production environment.
