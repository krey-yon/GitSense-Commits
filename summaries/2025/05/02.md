# Activity Summary for 5/2/2025

## 11:56:24 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `page.tsx`  between 11:07 AM and 11:30 AM on May 2nd, 2025, focusing on building a menu management section within a restaurant dashboard. Initially, the component was a placeholder using React Query for fetching menus.  Around 11:26 AM, significant changes were introduced, replacing the placeholder with UI elements for menu management: a title ("Menu Management"), a description, a separator,  `MenuItemForm`, and `MenuItemsList`.  There were subsequent changes refining component imports: `Separator` moved from `@radix-ui/react-select` to the project's own `@/components/ui/separator`, and `MenuItemForm` and `MenuItemsList` were imported from the project's component directory.  The `Restaurant` component was commented out.  There were some minor adjustments in how `menuId` was passed to the `MenuItemForm` and `MenuItemsList` components and eventually, `MenuItemForm` was removed completely from the `page.tsx` component at 11:30 AM.


Between 11:32 AM and 11:35 AM, `menu-item-form.tsx` was modified.  These changes involved adding a dialog component for the form, styling modifications, and refining the dialog's header and description. The initial version showed a placeholder DialogTrigger and commented-out DialogHeader, eventually replaced with a functional DialogTrigger showing a Plus icon and a DialogHeader with "Add Menu Item" as the title.
