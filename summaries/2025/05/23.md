# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 9:36:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `route.ts` (Salesforce OAuth callback) and `dbconnection.tsx` (database connection component).

**`route.ts` (Salesforce OAuth callback):**  This file underwent several revisions between 8:42 AM and 9:03 AM.  The initial versions used a JSON response to communicate success or failure.  Later versions (after 8:52 AM) were significantly altered to return an HTML page instead. This HTML page includes JavaScript to send a message to the parent window (presumably the application) indicating success or failure of the Salesforce connection, including the access token, refresh token, and instance URL in the success message. Error messages are also sent back to the parent window on failure.  The authentication check using `getAutonomisUser` was removed in the later versions.  The Salesforce API keys remained consistent across all versions, suggesting these are hardcoded, not fetched from environment variables.


**`dbconnection.tsx` (database connection component):** This file was updated once at 8:59 AM. This update doesn't appear to contain significant structural changes; however, it expands the functionality for handling various data sources (Salesforce, Hubspot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, MixPanel, and Airtable). The component is designed to test and manage database connections, using a polling mechanism (`pollingInterval`) for API connections to check for successful authentication. It handles form submission (`onSubmit`), storing connection strings and tokens, and provides feedback to the user via `react-hot-toast`. The component shows a clear pattern in how it interacts with different API endpoints and handles authentication tokens for each respective service.  The code to obtain authorization URLs for various services reveals reliance on environment variables (e.g., `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID`) for certain services like Hubspot, Zoho, and Google Analytics 4, but hardcoded values are used for Salesforce, reflecting a potential inconsistency in the configuration approach.


## 10:36:50 AM
The log shows multiple updates to several files within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` application, primarily focused on API connections and authentication.  The most significant changes occur between 9:43 AM and 9:50 AM, and again around 10:10 AM to 10:13 AM, affecting the `dbconnection.tsx` and `route.ts` files.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts`**: This file handles the Salesforce OAuth callback.  It retrieves the authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL, and then sets these as HTTP-only, secure cookies.  A success or failure message is displayed to the user, along with Javascript code that communicates the result to the parent window before closing.  The initial timestamp for this file is 5/23/2025, 9:42:02 AM.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\components\dbconnection.tsx`**: This React component manages database connections for various APIs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, MixPanel, Airtable).  It includes functions for testing and saving connections, handling authentication flows (especially noticeable for Salesforce and MixPanel), and managing form state.  There are many revisions to this file, from 9:43 AM to 9:50 AM, suggesting iterative development and debugging. A recurring pattern is the consistent use of `axios` for API calls,  `toast` for user feedback, and a similar structure for handling authentication and connection testing across different APIs.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\save-tokens\route.ts`**: This file handles saving Salesforce tokens to a Supabase database.  It retrieves tokens from the request body, gets the current user (or uses a dummy ID for development), and then uses Supabase's `upsert` function to save or update the tokens in the `salesforce_connections` table. Multiple updates between 9:52 AM and 9:53 AM are focused on correcting the GET method response.  The final version returns a JSON response indicating success or failure.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\salesforce\save-tokens\route.ts`**: This file, similar to the previous one, is also responsible for saving Salesforce tokens.  However, this file was added and updated later (between 10:10 AM and 10:13 AM).  The modifications focused on refining the GET and POST methods.  The GET method was added, corrected and simplified to return a success message; the POST method remains largely unchanged, consistently using Supabase to store tokens.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\test-connection\route.ts`**: This file is crucial for testing API connections.  It uses a switch statement to handle different APIs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, MixPanel, Airtable).  Initially, it fetched tokens from cookies.  However, between 10:17 AM and 10:19 AM, significant changes were made to fetch tokens from the Supabase database instead of cookies for Salesforce, improving security and maintainability.  The rest of the API connections still rely on cookie-based token retrieval.  The updated code for Salesforce includes error handling and checks for missing tokens.


Overall, the changes reflect a transition from cookie-based authentication to a database-backed approach for Salesforce, a common improvement for security and scalability.  The numerous updates to `dbconnection.tsx` show ongoing development and refinement of the database connection component, possibly involving bug fixes and feature additions.  The addition and refinement of the `save-tokens` routes specifically target Salesforce. The code consistently uses Supabase for database interaction.


## 11:36:33 AM
The provided log shows three revisions of the `dbconnection.tsx` file, all within a short timeframe on May 23, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged across these revisions, suggesting minor adjustments or possible bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions.  The file is a React component responsible for managing database connections, featuring functionality for testing, connecting, and disconnecting from various data sources (APIs and databases).  The component uses Axios for API calls, `react-hot-toast` for notifications, and a custom `useStepper` hook for a step-by-step user experience.

The component handles different data source types ('API' and 'database'), with specific connection logic for each.  API connections involve authentication using tokens obtained via various OAuth 2.0 flows (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, Airtable are explicitly mentioned).  The code includes error handling for connection failures and input validation to ensure all required fields are filled before submission.  Mixpanel is handled as a special case within the `saveAndNext` function.  The repeated identical code across the three revisions suggests that no functional changes were made between the timestamps.


## 12:36:37 PM
The log shows code changes primarily focused on API connection and OAuth authentication flows, specifically for Salesforce and other third-party apps.

The `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\test-connection\route.ts` file (first entry, 5/23/2025, 11:46:14 AM) implements an API endpoint that tests connections to various third-party applications (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4, Airtable).  It retrieves connection credentials from a Supabase database, based on the user and selected application.  The code then performs a test API call specific to each application to verify the connection, returning success or error information.


The `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts` file undergoes multiple revisions between 11:47:04 AM and 11:52:14 AM.  These revisions center on the Salesforce OAuth 2.0 callback route. The route exchanges an authorization code for access and refresh tokens, and then persists these tokens in both a Supabase database and cookies.  Initially, authentication checks were removed, and there's a notable evolution in how the user ID is obtained and used. There was a period (11:47:04 - 11:51:02) where the code used a "test-user-id" and then subsequently changed to retrieve the user ID from Supabase authentication.  The final change corrected a variable assignment error, making sure to use the Supabase retrieved user instead of the  request's user. The route returns an HTML page that communicates connection success or failure through a postMessage to the opener window.


The `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\components\dbconnection.tsx` file (last two entries, 5/23/2025, 12:31:14 PM and 12:31:22 PM) shows a React component responsible for managing database connections.  The component interacts with various APIs for testing connections and handling OAuth flows (though the full code for OAuth handling isn't shown).  It features a stepper, form handling, polling for connection status, and error handling. The function `getAuthURL` is particularly notable as it attempts to construct URLs for various OAuth flows using environment variables.  There were no actual code changes between the last two entries for this file


The overall pattern suggests a system designed for connecting and managing various data sources, involving a combination of direct API calls and OAuth 2.0 for authentication.  The evolution in the Salesforce callback route highlights iterative development and debugging.  The use of Supabase for credential storage and user management is consistent across the relevant code snippets.


## 1:36:34 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `route.ts` in the `save-tokens` and `test-connection` directories within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` application.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\salesforce\save-tokens\route.ts`**: This file underwent multiple revisions between 12:43 PM and 12:45 PM on May 23, 2025.  The primary change involved migrating Salesforce token storage from cookies to a Supabase database. Initially, the code stored `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and `instance_url` in cookies.  Later revisions removed the cookie storage, and updated the code to exclusively persist tokens within the `salesforce_connections` table in the Supabase database, using the `upsert` method.  A dummy user ID ('test-user-id') is used for development purposes if a user is not authenticated.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\test-connection\route.ts`**: This file was modified between 12:48 PM and 12:52 PM on May 23, 2025.  This route handles testing connections to various third-party applications (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4, and Airtable).  The significant change involved refactoring the Salesforce connection test to retrieve tokens from the Supabase database instead of relying on cookies, mirroring the changes made in the `save-tokens` route. A logging statement `console.log(response)` was added to the Salesforce case at 12:52 PM.  The other applications (HubSpot, Zoho, Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4, and Airtable) continue to retrieve tokens from cookies.  Each case within the switch statement handles authentication and API calls specific to each application.  The code uses axios for making HTTP requests to the respective APIs.


## 2:36:33 PM
The log shows two significant code changes on May 23, 2025.

The first change, at 2:01:22 PM, modifies `ExtractorConfigForm.tsx`. This component is a React form for configuring data extraction pipelines.  The update introduces a user interface for selecting extraction type (full or incremental), schedule (using cron syntax), objects to extract (with dynamic fetching based on source type), batch size, and storage type (local or S3).  The component fetches available objects via an API call to `/api/extractors/${sourceType}/objects` and handles user input to update the configuration state.  The default configuration includes a local storage path (`./extracted_data`).  Error handling is included for API calls and form validation.

The second change, at 2:06:36 PM, updates `route.ts` within the API folder, specifically handling requests to `/api/extractors/[source]/objects`. This API route fetches available objects for a given data source (`salesforce`, `zoho`, `hubspot`, `google_analytics`).  It uses Supabase to authenticate the user and retrieve connection details. Currently, it returns hardcoded default objects for each source type; a real implementation would dynamically fetch objects from the respective APIs. The route includes error handling and returns a JSON response indicating success or failure.  The authentication checks ensure only authorized users can access this endpoint.  There's a commented-out section hinting at potential future implementation of connection verification.


## 4:36:35 PM
The log shows several code changes within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` application on May 23, 2025.  The most significant changes relate to the creation and refinement of a data pipeline creation process.

`ExtractorConfigForm.tsx` (4:20:57 PM and 4:22:05 PM): This component underwent minor, insignificant code changes between the two timestamps.  The file defines a form for configuring data extraction, including parameters like extraction type ('full' or 'incremental'), schedule (cron expression), objects to extract, batch size, storage type ('local' or 's3'), and storage configuration. The component fetches available objects based on the selected source type ('salesforce' or 'zoho') from an API endpoint (`/api/extractors/{sourceType}/objects`). No functional changes were made in the second commit.


`PipelineDialogStepper.tsx` (4:33:36 PM and 4:33:43 PM): This component manages a multi-step dialog for creating data pipelines. The initial version defines steps for source, destination, and load configuration.  A key enhancement was the addition of an 'Extraction' step dynamically, based on the selected source type. The component uses `usePipelineActions` hook to interact with pipeline creation logic. The component also performs validation at each step, ensuring necessary data is provided, including checks for valid YAML configuration if used.  The changes between the two timestamps were minimal, consisting of additional parentheses to ensure correct logic in an conditional statement within an useEffect hook.

`ConnectWrapper.tsx` (4:34:02 PM, 4:34:23 PM, 4:34:31 PM): This component wraps the database connection process and presents a setup guide.  It utilizes `DBSidebar` and `DBConnectionWrapper` components. The component displays a setup guide with prerequisites, steps, troubleshooting tips, and support information.  The revisions during this timeframe focused exclusively on cosmetic and formatting changes to the setup guide's presentation (no change in functionality). The commented-out lines likely indicate removed or planned-for features. The function `handleSourceTypeSelect` suggests a mechanism for selecting source types.  The minor changes between 4:34:02 PM and 4:34:31 PM are not functionally significant.


## 5:36:43 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `usePipelineActions.ts` files in the `sync-pipelines` and `edge-functions` directories, and  `postgres_storage.py` and `factory.py` in the backend directory.  The majority of changes are between 4:53 PM and 5:05 PM on 5/23/2025, focusing on pipeline creation and deletion functionalities.  A later update at 5:21 PM and later at 5:32 PM  concerns the backend PostgreSQL storage.

**`usePipelineActions.ts` (sync-pipelines and edge-functions):**

The `usePipelineActions.ts` files in both directories underwent numerous revisions during the period mentioned above.  The core functionality remains consistent across revisions: creating, deleting, and managing pipelines.  The key differences are as follows:

* **`createPipelineSling` function:** This function, dedicated to Sling pipeline creation, saw substantial changes.  Initial versions lacked the `updateConfigWithTargetFileName()` function.  Subsequent revisions added it for modifying target filenames based on date and pipeline name, and also added support for more source and target types (like `local`, `hubspot`, `zoho`, etc.) and a dedicated file path handling for local storage.

* **`createDetails` function:** This function was enhanced to support additional source types, including `local`. This suggests an expansion of supported data sources for the pipelines.

* **Error Handling:**  Some commented-out error logging and toasts in the initial versions of `usePipelineActions.ts` (sync-pipelines) were removed in later versions. The error handling in the `edge-functions` version of the file remains minimal throughout the update process.


**`postgres_storage.py`:**

This file, updated at 5:21 PM and again at 5:32 PM,  introduces a `PostgresStorageManager` class responsible for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.  The class handles database connection, table existence checks, table creation from pandas DataFrames, and data insertion using `psycopg2`. Noteworthy are error handling with logging and transaction management (using `commit` and `rollback`).  The class also maintains metadata about the storage operation (rows written, table name, etc.).  The final version refactors the class name to `PostgresStorageManager` and moves the import of the `StorageManager` base class to a proper location.


**`factory.py`:**

Updated at 5:32 PM, this file contains a `StorageFactory` that now creates a `PostgresStorageManager` instance when the `storage_type` is "postgres", "postgresql", or "neon",  demonstrates a new way to handle different database types when creating the storage.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Extensive use of asynchronous functions (`async`/`await`) throughout the codebase points to a focus on non-blocking operations.
* Consistent error handling with `try...catch` blocks is present in all functions.
* Usage of `axios` (frontend) and `psycopg2` (backend) for communication with respective APIs and the database.
* Frequent use of JSON parsing for handling data structures.


The overall pattern suggests ongoing development and refinement of the data pipeline system, extending its capabilities, improving error handling, and enhancing the storage management system.


## 6:36:41 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `usePipelineActions.ts` file between 5:42 PM and 6:18 PM on May 23, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on refining pipeline creation (`createPipeline`, `createPipelineSling`) and deletion (`deletePipeline`) functionalities.  The initial versions of  `usePipelineActions.ts`  involved creating and deleting pipelines, interacting with both a Supabase server and an Airflow proxy for variable management.  The functions heavily rely on parsing JSON objects from `pipelineData` for source and target URLs, constructing database URLs based on type, and managing Airflow variables (parent and child) via an axios instance targeting `/api/airflow-proxy`.

A significant revision occurred around 5:46 PM, introducing an `isNotDatabase` helper function to improve handling of different data source/target types, distinguishing between API services, file storage, and databases. Further refinements between 5:58 PM and 6:18 PM involved categorizing source and target types (API_TYPES, FILE_STORAGE_TYPES, DATABASE_TYPES), improving `createDatabaseUrl` and `createDetails` functions to handle a wider variety of sources and targets (including salesforce, hubspot, zoho, etc), and more robust error handling.  The final version of `usePipelineActions.ts` at 6:18 PM exhibits a more organized structure and better type handling, especially concerning source and target tables.


The `factory.py` file, modified at 5:41 PM on the same day, implements a `StorageFactory` class. This factory method provides an abstraction layer to create different storage handlers (S3, Local, Postgres) based on configuration.  This change is independent of the subsequent `usePipelineActions.ts` modifications and does not show any further changes in the log.


## 9:36:33 PM
The file `usePipelineActions.ts` (modified 5/23/2025, 9:05:53 PM) contains React hooks for managing pipeline actions.  Key functions include `createPipeline`, `createPipelineSling`, and `deletePipeline`.  `createPipeline` and `createPipelineSling` handle creating pipelines, interacting with a Supabase server (`createPipelineServer`) and an Airflow proxy (`axiosInstance`) to create Airflow variables.  They parse source and target URLs, handling different database types (PostgreSQL, Salesforce, Snowflake, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery, MariaDB, MotherDuck, MongoDB, ClickHouse) and file storage types (S3, GCS, Azure). The `createDatabaseUrl` utility function constructs database connection strings based on the database type. `createConnectionName` generates names for Airflow connections.  `createAirflowVariables` sets up Airflow variables, utilizing `setParentAirflowVariable` and `createChildAirflowVariable` to manage parent and child DAG variables.  `deletePipeline` handles pipeline deletion, calling appropriate functions based on pipeline type (workflow, edge function, SQL notebook) before deleting Airflow DAGs and variables.  Error handling and loading states (`isLoading`) are implemented throughout. The code extensively uses asynchronous operations and incorporates robust error handling using `try...catch...finally` blocks.  The code also features a switch statement to handle different data source types, reflecting a flexible design to manage various data sources and targets.  The timestamp indicates a recent update to this file.


## 10:36:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `dbconnection.tsx` between 9:38:36 PM and 9:39:05 PM on May 23, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor and likely involve debugging or small adjustments to the code, as the overall functionality remains consistent across all revisions. No significant structural changes are observed. The only discernible change is within the `saveAndNext` function, where a `console.log` statement was added and then removed in subsequent commits.  The `console.log` statements printed "Destination" and "Destination config" then finally was removed entirely in the last commit.

A different file, `PipelineDialogStepper.tsx`, was updated twice at 9:39:56 PM and 9:40:10 PM on the same day. These changes are more substantial.  The second commit appears to be a very minor edit.  The major change involves adding an effect that dynamically updates the stepper's steps based on the source configuration.  Specifically, if the source is an API (Salesforce, Zoho, or HubSpot), an "Extraction" step is added to configure data extraction settings. The component's state management was improved to handle the added step. Validation for the 'Config' step was also enhanced to ensure that source and target table/object names are correctly specified.

Finally, `route.ts` was updated once at 10:27:57 PM. This file is an API route that acts as a proxy to an Airflow instance.  The update introduces more robust parameter handling for requests forwarded to the Airflow API, particularly around state parameters, handling edge cases in parameter input. The error handling within the route was also improved.  The `AIRFLOW_VM_URL` environment variable is used to construct the URL for forwarding requests; this variable's value is set to `http://localhost:8080` in the `.env.local` file.
