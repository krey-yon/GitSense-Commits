# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 9:36:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `route.ts` (Salesforce OAuth callback) and `dbconnection.tsx` (database connection component).

**`route.ts` (Salesforce OAuth callback):**  This file underwent several revisions between 8:42 AM and 9:03 AM.  The initial versions used a JSON response to communicate success or failure.  Later versions (after 8:52 AM) were significantly altered to return an HTML page instead. This HTML page includes JavaScript to send a message to the parent window (presumably the application) indicating success or failure of the Salesforce connection, including the access token, refresh token, and instance URL in the success message. Error messages are also sent back to the parent window on failure.  The authentication check using `getAutonomisUser` was removed in the later versions.  The Salesforce API keys remained consistent across all versions, suggesting these are hardcoded, not fetched from environment variables.


**`dbconnection.tsx` (database connection component):** This file was updated once at 8:59 AM. This update doesn't appear to contain significant structural changes; however, it expands the functionality for handling various data sources (Salesforce, Hubspot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, MixPanel, and Airtable). The component is designed to test and manage database connections, using a polling mechanism (`pollingInterval`) for API connections to check for successful authentication. It handles form submission (`onSubmit`), storing connection strings and tokens, and provides feedback to the user via `react-hot-toast`. The component shows a clear pattern in how it interacts with different API endpoints and handles authentication tokens for each respective service.  The code to obtain authorization URLs for various services reveals reliance on environment variables (e.g., `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID`) for certain services like Hubspot, Zoho, and Google Analytics 4, but hardcoded values are used for Salesforce, reflecting a potential inconsistency in the configuration approach.
