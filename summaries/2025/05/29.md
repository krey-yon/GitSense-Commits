# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 10:39:59 AM
The log shows code changes across three files within the `autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe` project on May 29, 2025.

`route.ts` (9:46:28 AM): This file handles Salesforce OAuth callbacks.  The main change is the removal of an authentication check,  making the callback accessible without prior authentication. The code exchanges an authorization code for a Salesforce access token, refresh token, and instance URL.  These tokens are then (commented out in the current version)  stored in a `autonmis_api_providers_table` in a Supabase database using a hardcoded user ID (231).  The access, refresh tokens, and instance URL are stored as HTTP-only cookies. Finally, the code sends a message to the opener window confirming successful or failed connection and closes itself after 3 seconds.

`dbconnection.tsx` (9:46:39 AM): This React component manages database connections. It handles testing connections for various database types (including APIs like Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, and Mixpanel), and storing connection details. The component uses polling to check for API connections and provides functionality to disconnect from APIs.  Significant parts of the code handle authentication flows for different APIs, obtaining and storing tokens, and managing connection states.  Error handling and user feedback (via `react-hot-toast`) are integrated. The component also fetches data source details, including field definitions, and handles form submission to save connection configuration.  There is extensive logic to validate the connection and configuration form data before submitting.  The code includes functionality to handle both existing and new connections.  Client-side authentication is implemented.

`PipelineDialogStepper.tsx` (10:33:30 AM): This component implements a stepper for configuring data pipelines.  It manages the configuration state for source and destination connections (including API and database connections), load configuration (mode, keys, schedule, etc.), and pipeline name. The component uses a state management approach to track progress across three steps: Source, Destination, and Config.  Validation is performed before proceeding to the next step and the component handles data submission.  It also includes functions to extract schema and database information from connection strings, differentiating between API, database, and cloud storage sources. The code is structured to support various data sources and their respective configurations, using a structured `configState` to store all relevant data.  A function `extractConnectionDetails` is added to improve how connection information is handled.  The function `validateLoadConfig` ensures that necessary fields are populated before proceeding with configuration.


## 11:39:57 AM
The provided log shows two nearly identical versions of `PipelineDialogStepper.tsx`  at 10:46:41 AM and 10:46:51 AM on May 29, 2025.  The only visible difference lies within the `validateLoadConfig` function.  The later version is truncated, but the visible portion indicates a potential bug fix or enhancement related to validating the lengths and content of `targetTableName`.  Specifically,  the later version appears to be adding a check to ensure that `targetTableName` is not empty, has the same length as `sourceTableName`, and doesn't contain empty or whitespace-only strings.  The rest of the component remains unchanged, suggesting that the modifications were focused solely on input validation for the "Config" step of the pipeline creation process.  The component defines a multi-step form for configuring data pipelines, handling source and destination configurations, load configurations, and validating inputs.  It uses React state management, custom hooks (`usePipelineActions`), and UI components for a step-by-step user experience.  The `extractConnectionDetails` function shows detailed handling of various database types (API, database, cloud).
