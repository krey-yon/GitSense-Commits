# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 10:52:52 AM
The codebase is an extractor framework with a focus on Salesforce data extraction and PostgreSQL data storage.  The `salesforce_connector.py` file underwent several revisions between 9:57 AM and 10:27 AM on May 22, 2025.  These changes primarily involved enhancing the authentication process. Initially, the connector relied solely on an access token.  Later versions added support for refresh token-based authentication and, significantly, introduced a password-based authentication method.  This was reflected in both the `salesforce_connector.py` file (addition of a new authentication method and handling of various auth scenarios) and the `config.json` file (addition of username, password, and security token fields, along with the `auth_method` configuration parameter). The final version of `salesforce_connector.py` improves authentication by attempting refresh token authentication and falling back to password authentication if needed, making it more robust.


The `_execute_query` function in `salesforce_connector.py`  was modified to improve session handling.  The initial implementation used a `tenacity` retry decorator for `SalesforceExpiredSession` and `RateLimitError`, but a later version removed the retry for expired sessions and instead implemented a loop with a maximum number of retry attempts, for a more refined approach to handling session expiration.


The `postgres_storage.py` file, added around 10:45 AM on May 22, 2025, provides a PostgreSQL storage handler.  This module handles database connections, table creation based on Pandas DataFrames, and data insertion using optimized `execute_values` methods.  There were minimal subsequent changes to this file in the provided log.
