# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 10:52:52 AM
The codebase is an extractor framework with a focus on Salesforce data extraction and PostgreSQL data storage.  The `salesforce_connector.py` file underwent several revisions between 9:57 AM and 10:27 AM on May 22, 2025.  These changes primarily involved enhancing the authentication process. Initially, the connector relied solely on an access token.  Later versions added support for refresh token-based authentication and, significantly, introduced a password-based authentication method.  This was reflected in both the `salesforce_connector.py` file (addition of a new authentication method and handling of various auth scenarios) and the `config.json` file (addition of username, password, and security token fields, along with the `auth_method` configuration parameter). The final version of `salesforce_connector.py` improves authentication by attempting refresh token authentication and falling back to password authentication if needed, making it more robust.


The `_execute_query` function in `salesforce_connector.py`  was modified to improve session handling.  The initial implementation used a `tenacity` retry decorator for `SalesforceExpiredSession` and `RateLimitError`, but a later version removed the retry for expired sessions and instead implemented a loop with a maximum number of retry attempts, for a more refined approach to handling session expiration.


The `postgres_storage.py` file, added around 10:45 AM on May 22, 2025, provides a PostgreSQL storage handler.  This module handles database connections, table creation based on Pandas DataFrames, and data insertion using optimized `execute_values` methods.  There were minimal subsequent changes to this file in the provided log.


## 1:54:39 PM
The log shows numerous updates to the `.env.local` file between 1:06 PM and 1:46 PM on May 22, 2025.  These changes primarily involve configuring Supabase and PostgreSQL connection details.  The Supabase URL was changed at least once from `https://jrqzgsdusumqwybdjlri.supabase.co` to `https://nxfgdavcafafaoyxxweh.supabase.co`. The Supabase anonymous key (`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) was also updated multiple times, reflecting different Supabase projects.  Note that the keys themselves are redacted for security.


The PostgreSQL configuration underwent several changes.  Initially, the database name and user were missing; later, these were filled in with `neondb`, `neondb_owner` then finally updated to `mydatabase` and `myuser` respectively.  A password was added for PostgreSQL at 1:42 PM.

Between 1:14 PM and 1:18 PM, there were several redundant entries in `.env.local`. These entries contained duplicated Supabase URL and key values. These duplicates were subsequently removed.


Finally, between 1:36 PM and 1:37 PM,  the `app\login\page.tsx` file and `app\login\Login.tsx` files were updated. These updates do not appear to impact the environment variables but instead enhance the login functionality by using those variables from the `.env.local` file.  The login page now redirects users to '/info' if their registration is incomplete and to '/home' if it is complete.  The login component itself was significantly updated, adding more robust error handling, password reset functionality, and Google login integration.
