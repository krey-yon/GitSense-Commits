# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 10:52:52 AM
The codebase is an extractor framework with a focus on Salesforce data extraction and PostgreSQL data storage.  The `salesforce_connector.py` file underwent several revisions between 9:57 AM and 10:27 AM on May 22, 2025.  These changes primarily involved enhancing the authentication process. Initially, the connector relied solely on an access token.  Later versions added support for refresh token-based authentication and, significantly, introduced a password-based authentication method.  This was reflected in both the `salesforce_connector.py` file (addition of a new authentication method and handling of various auth scenarios) and the `config.json` file (addition of username, password, and security token fields, along with the `auth_method` configuration parameter). The final version of `salesforce_connector.py` improves authentication by attempting refresh token authentication and falling back to password authentication if needed, making it more robust.


The `_execute_query` function in `salesforce_connector.py`  was modified to improve session handling.  The initial implementation used a `tenacity` retry decorator for `SalesforceExpiredSession` and `RateLimitError`, but a later version removed the retry for expired sessions and instead implemented a loop with a maximum number of retry attempts, for a more refined approach to handling session expiration.


The `postgres_storage.py` file, added around 10:45 AM on May 22, 2025, provides a PostgreSQL storage handler.  This module handles database connections, table creation based on Pandas DataFrames, and data insertion using optimized `execute_values` methods.  There were minimal subsequent changes to this file in the provided log.


## 1:54:39 PM
The log shows numerous updates to the `.env.local` file between 1:06 PM and 1:46 PM on May 22, 2025.  These changes primarily involve configuring Supabase and PostgreSQL connection details.  The Supabase URL was changed at least once from `https://jrqzgsdusumqwybdjlri.supabase.co` to `https://nxfgdavcafafaoyxxweh.supabase.co`. The Supabase anonymous key (`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) was also updated multiple times, reflecting different Supabase projects.  Note that the keys themselves are redacted for security.


The PostgreSQL configuration underwent several changes.  Initially, the database name and user were missing; later, these were filled in with `neondb`, `neondb_owner` then finally updated to `mydatabase` and `myuser` respectively.  A password was added for PostgreSQL at 1:42 PM.

Between 1:14 PM and 1:18 PM, there were several redundant entries in `.env.local`. These entries contained duplicated Supabase URL and key values. These duplicates were subsequently removed.


Finally, between 1:36 PM and 1:37 PM,  the `app\login\page.tsx` file and `app\login\Login.tsx` files were updated. These updates do not appear to impact the environment variables but instead enhance the login functionality by using those variables from the `.env.local` file.  The login page now redirects users to '/info' if their registration is incomplete and to '/home' if it is complete.  The login component itself was significantly updated, adding more robust error handling, password reset functionality, and Google login integration.


## 2:54:38 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `.env.local` file within a short time frame (between 1:55:14 PM and 1:55:42 PM on May 22, 2025).  The file contains environment variables for a PostgreSQL database and Supabase.

The key changes revolve around the `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` variables.  Initially, there were two sets of these variables, one prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and the other without.  The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are likely meant to be accessible client-side while the others are for server-side use.

The first two updates modify the `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` values for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed variable. The first change (1:55:14 PM) seems to have contained an incorrect or outdated key.  The second change (1:55:22 PM) corrected this to a new key with an updated expiry time.  The final update (1:55:42 PM) removes the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and uses only `nxfgdavcafafaoyxxweh.supabase.co` for the Supabase connection, seemingly favoring this URL over the previously used `jrqzgsdusumqwybdjlri.supabase.co`.  The `OPENAI_API_KEY` remains consistently empty throughout.  The PostgreSQL database connection details remain unchanged.


## 5:54:37 PM
The log shows modifications to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\page.tsx`.  The file is a React component that fetches and displays data pipelines from a Supabase database.

Initially (5:15:52 PM), the component contained commented-out authentication logic.  This was replaced at 5:16:15 PM with a hardcoded `user` object for testing purposes (`{ id: 'test-user-id' }`).  A nearly identical version of this code remains at 5:16:20 PM. Finally, at 5:18:29 PM, the commented-out authentication was uncommented and reactivated, removing the temporary hardcoded user.  The authentication uses `getAutonomisUser` to retrieve user data and redirects to login if necessary. The code consistently fetches pipelines from the `autonomis_user_ingestion_pipeline` table in Supabase using the user ID.  The UI remains consistent across all versions, displaying a sidebar and the fetched pipelines within a `PipelinePageWrapper` component.


## 6:54:42 PM
The `HomeWrapper.tsx` component was updated on May 22, 2025, at 6:28:14 PM.  This update significantly enhances the user onboarding experience by dynamically generating dummy data and displaying tailored content based on the user's status.

Key changes include:

* **Dummy Data Generation:** The component now incorporates a `generateDummyItems` function. This asynchronous function fetches data from several server endpoints (`fetchDummyConnectorsServer`, `createUserDummyDatabaseServer`, `fetchDummyNotebookServer`, `createUserDummyNotebookServer`, `fetchMetricForDummyNotebook`, `createUserMetricServer`, `createUserDashboardServer`, `updateUserRegistrationServer`) to create dummy notebooks, metrics, and dashboards for new users.  The function uses UUIDs to ensure unique IDs for generated items. It handles potential errors from each server call.

* **Conditional Rendering:** Based on whether dummy data has been generated (`isDummyGenerated`) and the number of existing notebooks (`hasEnoughNotebooks`), the component renders different UI elements.  If the user lacks enough notebooks, onboarding cards (`OnboardingCards`) are displayed. Otherwise, a summary wrapper (`SummaryWrapper`) is shown.

* **User Onboarding:** The component displays a set of onboarding cards (`homeChildren`) to guide the user through creating data sources, notebooks, and utilizing the SQL editor.

* **Loading State:** An `AppLoader` component is displayed while the dummy data is being generated, improving the user experience.


The code uses several external libraries including `react`, `lucide-react`, `uuid`, and `next/link` for UI elements, icons, and routing.  The frequent use of asynchronous calls and error handling suggests a robust approach to data fetching and management.  The structure indicates a focus on a smooth and interactive first-time user experience within a data analytics application.
