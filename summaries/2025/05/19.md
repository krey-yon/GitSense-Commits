# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 4:41:03 PM
The code implements a Salesforce data extractor that authenticates with Salesforce, retrieves data, transforms it into a Pandas DataFrame, and saves it to either S3 or the local file system.

The `salesforce_connector.py` file underwent several revisions between 3:45 PM and 3:48 PM on May 19, 2025, primarily focusing on the `SalesforceConnector` class.  This class was fleshed out to include methods for authentication (`authenticate`), token validation (`is_token_valid`), token refresh (`refresh_token`), fetching available objects (`get_available_objects`), and getting object fields (`get_object_fields`).  The `authenticate` method now includes token refresh logic.  Error handling was significantly improved, adding handling for `SalesforceExpiredSession`, `SalesforceRefusedRequest`, and general exceptions, with appropriate logging. The final version also introduced retry logic using the `tenacity` library for handling expired sessions and rate limits within the `_execute_query` method and added support for different output formats (csv, parquet, json) in the data extraction process.

Between 4:08 PM and 4:10 PM on May 19, 2025, the `api_connector.py` file was updated to create a base class `APIConnector` defining the interface for interacting with APIs.  This class includes abstract methods for authentication, token validation, token refresh, object and field retrieval, and data extraction.  It also provides common functionalities like logging setup and a `rate_limit_handler`.

The `storage_manager.py` file was modified between 4:09 PM and 4:15 PM on May 19, 2025.  An abstract base class `StorageManager` was introduced, and two concrete implementations, `S3StorageManager` and `LocalStorageManager`, were added for S3 and local file system storage, respectively. The `S3StorageManager` handles saving DataFrames to S3 buckets in different formats (csv, parquet, json) with optional compression. The `LocalStorageManager` provides similar functionality for local file system storage. Both classes maintain metadata about the storage operations.

Finally, the `salesforce_extractor.py` file (modified between 4:15 PM and 4:20 PM on May 19, 2025) is the main entry point for the Salesforce data extraction. The `SalesforceExtractor` class uses the `SalesforceConnector` and the chosen `StorageManager` (S3 or local) to extract data from Salesforce based on the provided configuration.  It supports incremental extraction based on a timestamp and allows specifying fields, filters, and destinations. It also logs detailed metrics and outputs a summary of extraction status.  A significant change involves the addition of more comprehensive error handling and improved logging, especially in the `extract_object` method. The `extract_objects` method handles multiple object extraction configurations.


## 5:40:54 PM
The code defines a `SalesforceExtractor` class designed to extract data from Salesforce, transform it, and store it using either S3 or local storage.  The class is initialized with credentials, connector, storage, and extraction configurations.

The core functionality lies in `extract_object` and `extract_objects`.  `extract_object` handles the extraction of a single Salesforce object,  managing logging, metrics (including start/end times, record counts, success/failure status, and error messages), and data saving.  It supports incremental extraction based on a timestamp and allows specifying fields, filters, and the output destination. Data is extracted using a `SalesforceConnector`, transformed (likely using pandas), and stored using either `S3StorageManager` or `LocalStorageManager`.  Error handling is included, logging failures appropriately.

`extract_objects` iterates through a configuration list to extract multiple objects, accumulating overall metrics.

The log shows a single code update on May 19th, 2025, at 4:52:33 PM. This update includes the complete implementation of the `SalesforceExtractor` class, demonstrating a substantial initial development or refactoring of this data extraction module.  The code utilizes logging extensively, making debugging and monitoring easier.  The use of pandas suggests data manipulation and transformation capabilities.  The configuration-driven approach promotes flexibility and reusability.
