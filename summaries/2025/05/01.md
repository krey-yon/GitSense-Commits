# Activity Summary for 5/1/2025

## 10:06:55 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `restaurant.ts` and `restaurant.tsx`,  and `user-profile.tsx`.

The `restaurant.ts` file,  from 9:41 PM to 9:50 PM, underwent multiple edits.  Initially, it was a blank action file. It was then progressively developed to include  an asynchronous function `restaurantInfo` that fetches restaurant details using Prisma ORM based on a provided `restaurantId`.  There were several revisions related to error handling (`try...catch`) and the `include` option within the `findFirst` Prisma query. The `include` option was experimented with, eventually being removed in the final version.

The `restaurant.tsx` file, between 9:50 PM and 9:56 PM, was modified to display restaurant information.  It started by referencing a missing `restaurant` variable and then it imported and used the `restaurantInfo` action created in  `restaurant.ts` to fetch the data.  Several iterations refined how the component handles potential null values in `restaurant` properties using optional chaining (`?.`) and the non-null assertion operator (`!`). Finally, it started generating a random delivery time and a rating between 4 and 5.


The `user-profile.tsx` file was modified between 10:00 PM and 10:00:34 PM. The only change here is removing the `onClick` from the Log In button.  No functionality was added or changed.


## 11:07:07 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\app\dashboard\user\page.tsx` file, with some modifications to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\actions\restaurant.ts` as well.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\app\dashboard\user\page.tsx` Changes:**

The major changes in this file revolve around fetching and displaying restaurant data, implementing search and sort functionalities. Initially, the component used static restaurant data (`restaurants` from `@/lib/data`).  Between 10:12 PM and 10:20 PM, the code was extensively refactored to fetch data from an API endpoint (`/api/restaurants`) using `allRestaurantData` action, which in turn uses `prisma` to interact with the database.  This involved adding state variables for managing search terms (`searchTerm`, `sortBy`) and filtered results (`filteredRestaurants`).  The  `useEffect` hook was initially commented out but was later reactivated to handle search and sorting of restaurant data.


Between 10:24 PM and 10:27 PM, a "random" sort option was added to the dropdown menu.  Around 10:37 PM, `filteredRestaurants` was initialized as an empty array,  to ensure correct initial rendering.  Between 10:38 PM and 10:42 PM,  the code underwent additional refactorings involving state management. Finally, the `useEffect` hook responsible for fetching data was corrected to include `data || []` to handle cases where `data` might be null or undefined. The final version fetches restaurant data using `allRestaurantData`,  implements search filtering based on restaurant name and cuisine, and allows sorting by name (A-Z, Z-A) and randomly.  A default image (`/default-image.jpg`) is used if a restaurant doesn't have an image URL.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\actions\restaurant.ts` Changes:**

This file contains functions to fetch restaurant data.  The initial changes between 10:15 PM and 10:16 PM involved the creation of `allRestaurantData` function to fetch all restaurant entries, initially with incomplete code.  It was gradually completed to correctly use `prisma.restaurant.findMany({})` to retrieve all restaurants.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Consistent use of functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useDebounce`) in React.
* Error handling with `try...catch` blocks in the actions file.
* The use of Prisma ORM for database interaction in the actions file.
* Consistent use of default image URL (`/default-image.jpg`) to handle missing images.


In summary, the code evolved from using static data to fetching and dynamically displaying data from a database via an API endpoint, significantly improving flexibility and maintainability.  The addition of a random sort option and robust error handling also enhanced functionality and user experience. The final code showcases a well-structured React application with efficient data handling and a user-friendly interface.
