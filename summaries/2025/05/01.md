# Activity Summary for 5/1/2025

## 10:06:55 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `restaurant.ts` and `restaurant.tsx`,  and `user-profile.tsx`.

The `restaurant.ts` file,  from 9:41 PM to 9:50 PM, underwent multiple edits.  Initially, it was a blank action file. It was then progressively developed to include  an asynchronous function `restaurantInfo` that fetches restaurant details using Prisma ORM based on a provided `restaurantId`.  There were several revisions related to error handling (`try...catch`) and the `include` option within the `findFirst` Prisma query. The `include` option was experimented with, eventually being removed in the final version.

The `restaurant.tsx` file, between 9:50 PM and 9:56 PM, was modified to display restaurant information.  It started by referencing a missing `restaurant` variable and then it imported and used the `restaurantInfo` action created in  `restaurant.ts` to fetch the data.  Several iterations refined how the component handles potential null values in `restaurant` properties using optional chaining (`?.`) and the non-null assertion operator (`!`). Finally, it started generating a random delivery time and a rating between 4 and 5.


The `user-profile.tsx` file was modified between 10:00 PM and 10:00:34 PM. The only change here is removing the `onClick` from the Log In button.  No functionality was added or changed.
