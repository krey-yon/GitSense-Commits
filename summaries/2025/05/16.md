# Activity Summary for 5/16/2025

## 8:15:53 AM
The log shows development of two React components: `HowItWorksPage` and `StepsCard`.  The `HowItWorksPage` component initially contained placeholder text and an image.  Between 7:28 AM and 7:29 AM, minor styling adjustments were made to the layout using Tailwind CSS classes. Then, the main content was removed, replaced by a placeholder `div` at 7:29:24 AM.

The `StepsCard` component underwent significant changes starting from its basic creation at 7:29:50 AM.  It evolved from an empty div to include an image, a button, and finally descriptive text and styling, all completed by 8:00:42 AM.  Many revisions between 7:37 AM and 8:00 AM focused on styling elements using Tailwind CSS. The styling involved changes to image dimensions, button replacement with a span,  and text styling (font, color, padding).

At 7:47:55 AM, the `StepsCard` component was temporarily commented out before being replaced with a completely different implementation at 7:48:06 AM,  representing a substantial design shift.  Further refinements to the `StepsCard` component's styling and content continued until 8:00:42 AM.


Finally, between 8:00 AM and 8:14 AM, the `HowItWorksPage` was updated to utilize the completed `StepsCard` component by mapping over `stepsCardData` from the newly created `data.ts` file. This file contained  structured data for the `StepsCard` components that was progressively refined in `HowItWorksPage` between 8:01 AM and 8:09 AM. The final `HowItWorksPage` displays the `StepsCard` components in a grid layout at 8:14:54 AM, completing the integration.
