# Activity Summary for 5/26/2025

## 11:34:43 AM
The log shows Dockerfile modifications across two distinct projects.  The first, `atnms-mono-datapipe\backend\docker\Dockerfile` (11:04:51 AM), sets up a Python 3.9 application.  It uses a slim Python base image, copies requirements and application code, installs dependencies using pip, exposes port 5001, sets environment variables (`FLASK_APP`, `PYTHONPATH`), and runs a Flask application.


The second Dockerfile, `atnms-mono-datapipe\Dockerfile` (11:10:15 AM), builds a Node.js application. It uses a multi-stage build process. The `deps` stage installs dependencies (using either yarn, npm, or pnpm based on lockfile presence).  The `builder` stage copies dependencies, builds the application, and the `runner` stage sets up a user, copies build artifacts, and runs the application using `node server.js`, exposing port 3000.  Both Dockerfiles demonstrate a common pattern of using multi-stage builds for efficient image creation, and both include extensive environment variable settings.  The Node.js build specifically handles multiple package managers (yarn, npm, and pnpm) robustly, making it more flexible.
