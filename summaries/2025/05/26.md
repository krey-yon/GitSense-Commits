# Activity Summary for 5/26/2025

## 11:34:43 AM
The log shows Dockerfile modifications across two distinct projects.  The first, `atnms-mono-datapipe\backend\docker\Dockerfile` (11:04:51 AM), sets up a Python 3.9 application.  It uses a slim Python base image, copies requirements and application code, installs dependencies using pip, exposes port 5001, sets environment variables (`FLASK_APP`, `PYTHONPATH`), and runs a Flask application.


The second Dockerfile, `atnms-mono-datapipe\Dockerfile` (11:10:15 AM), builds a Node.js application. It uses a multi-stage build process. The `deps` stage installs dependencies (using either yarn, npm, or pnpm based on lockfile presence).  The `builder` stage copies dependencies, builds the application, and the `runner` stage sets up a user, copies build artifacts, and runs the application using `node server.js`, exposing port 3000.  Both Dockerfiles demonstrate a common pattern of using multi-stage builds for efficient image creation, and both include extensive environment variable settings.  The Node.js build specifically handles multiple package managers (yarn, npm, and pnpm) robustly, making it more flexible.


## 6:03:26 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple API route files and a database connection component between May 26, 2025, 5:25 PM and 5:44 PM.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\airflow-proxy\route.ts`**: This file, updated at 5:25:45 PM, defines a POST API route that acts as a proxy to an Airflow instance.  A hardcoded URL (`http://44.209.110.93:8080/api/v1`) replaces a previous environment variable-based URL for the Airflow VM. The route handles requests, including parameters like `state`, `start_date_gte`, `limit`, and `order_by`, forwarding them to the Airflow API and returning the response.  Error handling is included to manage potential issues with the proxy request.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\pipeline-logs\route.ts`**: This file undergoes multiple revisions (5:31:16 PM, 5:31:23 PM, 5:43:07 PM, 5:43:38 PM, 5:43:44 PM).  It defines a GET API route to fetch pipeline logs.  Initially, it uses an environment variable (`AIRFLOW_VM_SLING_URL`) for the API URL, but this is subsequently replaced with hardcoded URLs:  "" (empty string), and finally  `"http://localhost:5001/"`. The route retrieves  `dagId` and `dagRunId` from request parameters, calls an external API (`/job_status`), and returns the response.  Extensive logging is added throughout the revisions for debugging purposes.  A key change is the addition of console logging of the API response.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts`**: Updated at 5:44:47 PM, this file handles the Salesforce OAuth callback. It exchanges an authorization code for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL.  The code then attempts to store these tokens in a `autonmis_api_providers_table` using Supabase.  If successful, it sets HTTP-only cookies for the access token, refresh token, and instance URL.  Regardless of success or failure, it returns an HTML page that communicates the result back to the opener window via postMessage. The hardcoded client ID and secret are present.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\components\dbconnection.tsx`**: This React component, updated at 5:44:55 PM, handles database connections. It allows testing and saving database connection details. The component interacts with various API endpoints for connection testing and authentication, including  `/api/apiConnect/disconnect`, `/api/apiConnect/test-connection`, and `/api/testconnection`.  It supports different data sources (API, database) and includes handling for OAuth flows for Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, and Airtable.  It uses hardcoded client IDs and redirect URIs for some services.  Error handling and user feedback (via `react-hot-toast`) are implemented. The component fetches data source details using `getDataSourceDetail`.


A recurring pattern is the shift from using environment variables to hardcoded URLs/values in multiple API routes.  This suggests a possible development or testing environment change.  The extensive logging added to the pipeline-logs route highlights a debugging effort.  The Salesforce OAuth callback demonstrates a complete OAuth 2.0 flow, including token exchange and secure cookie storage. The DBConnection component provides a comprehensive UI for managing various database connections, highlighting a robust approach to data source integration.


## 7:50:56 PM
The log shows code changes on May 26, 2025, affecting two files: `route.ts` and `dbconnection.tsx`.

`route.ts` (Salesforce OAuth Callback):  This file handles the OAuth callback for Salesforce.  The most significant change between the two timestamps is the update to the `REDIRECT_URI` from `https://2e82-103-212-145-189.ngrok-free.app/api/apiConnect/oauth/callback/salesforce` to `https://fd19-103-212-145-189.ngrok-free.app/api/apiConnect/oauth/callback/salesforce`, indicating a change in the ngrok tunnel URL. The code exchanges the authorization code for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL from Salesforce.  It then attempts to store these tokens in a Supabase database (although the upsert operation is commented out). Finally, it sets cookies for the tokens and returns an HTML page to signal successful connection or failure to the calling application.


`dbconnection.tsx` (Database Connection Component): This React component manages database connections.  It supports various data sources ('API', 'database') and handles authentication flows (e.g., Salesforce, Hubspot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, Airtable). There is no significant change in the logic between the two snapshots, only the `REDIRECT_URI` in the `getAuthURL` function for salesforce is changed to reflect the same change mentioned above. The component features connection testing, polling for connection status, and handling of various authentication flows with error handling and user feedback via toasts.  The `getAuthURL` function constructs OAuth URLs for different API providers, using environment variables where possible.  There's a noticeable pattern of using `axios` for API calls and `react-hot-toast` for user notifications.  The component also uses a stepper component (`useStepper`) for a guided user experience.
