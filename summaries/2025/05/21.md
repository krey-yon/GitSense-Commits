# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 11:38:02 PM
The primary changes involved setting up a Salesforce data extraction framework.

On May 21, 2025, at 11:01:45 PM, `run.py` was updated to implement the extraction logic. This script uses a `SalesforceExtractor` class (presumably defined elsewhere) to extract data based on configurations loaded from `config.json`.  The extracted data is then printed in JSON format.

At 11:02:12 PM,  `requirements.txt` was modified to list the project's dependencies, including libraries for data manipulation (pandas), Salesforce API interaction (simple-salesforce), cloud storage (boto3), retry mechanisms (tenacity), and workflow orchestration (apache-airflow).

Finally, at 11:37:45 PM, `config.json` was updated to contain the configuration parameters for the Salesforce connection (credentials), data extraction (batch size, timeout, etc.), data storage (local directory, file format), and the specific Salesforce object (`Account`) and fields to extract.  The configuration suggests an incremental extraction approach.
