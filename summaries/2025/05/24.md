# Activity Summary for 5/24/2025

## 9:39:31 AM
The log shows numerous code changes across several files within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` application.  The primary focus appears to be on data pipeline creation and management, with significant interaction with a Supabase database and an Airflow system (likely for orchestrating data pipelines).

**`route.ts` (Airflow Proxy):**  This file underwent multiple revisions between 9:01:35 AM and 9:02:30 AM.  The key change was replacing the dynamic URL (`process.env.AIRFLOW_VM_URL`) with a hardcoded URL (`http://localhost:8080/api/v1`). This suggests a shift from a dynamically configured Airflow instance to a locally running instance at port 8080.

**`query.ts`:** This file contains numerous functions interacting with the Supabase database. Multiple revisions between 9:24:25 AM and 9:25:24 AM indicate debugging or refinement of the `createPipelineServer` function.  The added `console.log` statements in several versions suggest troubleshooting pipeline creation issues.  The functions consistently use Supabase's client to perform CRUD operations on various tables related to user data, pipelines, notebooks, workflows, and data sources. A recurring pattern is the use of `workspace_idv2` and `flow_project_idv2` suggesting a versioning or migration of workspace and project IDs.

**`usePipelineActions.ts` (Sync Pipelines):**  This file shows substantial changes between 9:26:41 AM and 9:37:49 AM, focusing on pipeline creation and deletion.  The `createPipelineSling` function was significantly revised to handle different source and target types (including file storage like S3) and to modify the target file name based on the date and pipeline name.  The function utilizes `createAirflowVariables` and `deleteAirflowVariables` for interacting with the Airflow system.  The handling of various database types (Postgres, Snowflake, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery) is also prominent, suggesting flexibility in data source/destination choices.  Added `console.log` statements throughout the code help in debugging, specifically logging pipeline data, errors, and array types.


**`PipelineDialogStepper.tsx`:**  This component manages the steps in a pipeline creation dialog. The code implements a stepper component with steps for source, destination, and configuration.  The state management includes handling various configuration options including `sourceConfig`, `destinationConfig`, and `loadConfig`, with different data types.  A key feature is the dynamic addition of an "Extraction" step based on the source type. The component interacts with the `usePipelineActions` hook for pipeline creation.

**`route.ts` (Salesforce OAuth Callback):** This file, updated at 8:42:39 AM, handles the Salesforce OAuth callback. It retrieves the authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL, then stores these in the Supabase `api_connections` table and sets corresponding cookies.  The response to the callback is an HTML page that communicates the success (or failure) of the connection back to the main application. The removal of an authentication check indicates that this function only deals with the OAuth flow and any authentication is handled elsewhere.

The overall pattern across these changes suggests ongoing development and refinement of the data pipeline creation and management features within the application.  The frequent updates, particularly in `query.ts` and `usePipelineActions.ts`, point to active debugging and integration work with Supabase and Airflow.


## 10:39:26 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two files within a short time frame on May 24, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be on the `usePipelineActions.ts` file, which manages pipeline creation and deletion.  `query.ts`  undergoes changes related to database interactions, primarily using Supabase.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\edge-functions\components\usePipelineActions.ts`:**

This file contains numerous functions for interacting with pipelines:

* **`createPipeline`:** Creates a pipeline, handling Supabase interaction and Airflow variable creation.  Several revisions show debugging `console.log` statements added and removed, suggesting troubleshooting efforts.
* **`createPipelineSling`:**  A similar pipeline creation function, but seemingly designed for different source categories ('API', 'database', 'cloud') and handling file-based sources and targets differently.  This function also had debugging `console.log` statements that were eventually removed.
* **`deletePipeline`:** Deletes a pipeline, also managing interactions with Supabase and Airflow, and considering different pipeline types (Workflows, Edge Functions, SQL Notebooks).
* **`createDetails`, `createDatabaseUrl`, `createConnectionName`, `createAirflowVariables`, `setParentAirflowVariable`, `createChildAirflowVariable`:**  These are helper functions supporting pipeline creation and deletion.  They handle database URL construction, Airflow variable management, and details extraction from various database types.  The `createDetails` function shows a switch statement for handling different data source types (s3, redshift, salesforce, bigquery, mongodb).

The revisions to `usePipelineActions.ts` between 9:39:36 AM and 9:42:36 AM primarily involve adding `console.log` statements for debugging purposes, and then subsequently removing them once the issues were likely resolved.  This indicates iterative development and debugging.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\dbQueries\query.ts`:**

This file contains various functions for interacting with a Supabase database:

* Numerous functions (`getFlowProjects`, `updateWorkspaceTab`, `fetchWorkspaceNbsServer`, `checkExistingPyNotebook`, `createNewPyNotebook`, etc.) are dedicated to managing various aspects of the application's data, such as retrieving workspace information, notebooks, edge functions, and workflows, as well as creating and updating entries.  These functions all use a consistent pattern of fetching data from Supabase tables.
* `createPipelineServer`, `deletePipelineForWorkflow`, `deletePipelineForEdge`, `deletePipelineForSqlNotebook`, and `deletePipelineServer`: handle pipeline related Supabase operations.  The `createPipelineServer` function also saw debugging statements added and then removed in later revisions.  The deletion functions seem to update the `dag_id` field to null, possibly indicating a decoupling of the pipeline from its Airflow DAG.

The revision at 9:43:34 AM shows a complete set of Supabase interaction functions for different parts of the application.  There's a clear pattern of using Supabase's client to interact with various tables (`autonomis_user_flow_projectv2`, `autonomis_user_py_notebook`, `autonomis_user_edge_functions`, etc.).

In summary, the code changes reflect active development and debugging, focused on pipeline management functionality, leveraging Supabase for database interactions, and Airflow for task orchestration.  The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development and debugging of the pipeline creation and deletion processes.


## 12:39:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the file `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts` between 12:02 PM and 12:05 PM on May 24, 2025.  The file is a Next.js API route handling the Salesforce OAuth callback.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: it receives an authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL from Salesforce using `axios`, stores these tokens in a Supabase database (`api_connections` table), sets corresponding HTTP-only cookies (`sf_access_token`, `sf_refresh_token`, `sf_instance_url`), and returns an HTML page that communicates the success or failure of the connection to the parent window via `postMessage`.

The main changes between revisions involve the destructuring of the `tokenResponse.data` object. Initially, only `access_token`, `instance_url`, and `refresh_token` were extracted. Subsequent revisions added `user_id` and finally `organization_id`, suggesting a progressive refinement to capture more information from the Salesforce OAuth response.  These changes happened rapidly, between 12:04 PM and 12:05 PM.  There were no other significant functional changes to the code.


## 1:39:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of two files: `route.ts` and `query.ts`.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts`:** This file underwent several revisions between 12:58 PM and 1:38 PM on May 24, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent:  it handles the Salesforce OAuth callback, exchanges an authorization code for access and refresh tokens, stores these tokens in a Supabase database (`autonmis_api_providers_table`), sets cookies for these tokens, and then returns an HTML page to communicate success (or failure) to the calling window.

The primary changes across revisions involved logging statements (adding `console.log` for debugging purposes,  specifically logging the result of the Supabase upsert operation, and refining the logging message for successful token insertion) and a minor code cleanup (removing unnecessary comma). One version briefly had a typographical error (`console.log(us)` instead of `console.log(user)`). The core logic of the OAuth flow, token storage, and cookie setting remained unchanged.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\edge-functions\dbQueries\query.ts`:** This file contains numerous functions for interacting with a Supabase database.  All functions use the `createClient` function to establish a Supabase client and perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on several tables including  `autonomis_user_flow_projectv2`, `autonomis_user_edge_functions`,  `autonomis_user_notebook`, and others.  Each function is designed to fetch, update, or delete specific data related to workflows, edge functions, notebooks, and pipelines based on ID or other criteria. There are no modifications recorded in the provided log for this file.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\dbQueries\query.ts`:** This file, similar to `query.ts` in the `edge-functions` directory, also contains multiple functions for interacting with the Supabase database. It features numerous functions for creating, updating, and retrieving data related to Python notebooks, edge functions, workflows, and data sources.  The changes occurred between 1:14 PM and 1:21 PM on May 24, 2025.  The key change was removing the `extraction_config` field from the `pipelineData` object before inserting it into the `autonomis_user_ingestion_pipeline` table in the `createPipelineServer` function.  This suggests a refactoring to handle the `extraction_config` differently. There were also some minor updates to logging statements. The overall structure and functionality of the Supabase database interactions remained the same.

The recurring theme throughout both files is heavy reliance on Supabase for data persistence and management.  The functions are concise and focused on specific database operations.
