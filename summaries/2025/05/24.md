# Activity Summary for 5/24/2025

## 9:39:31 AM
The log shows numerous code changes across several files within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` application.  The primary focus appears to be on data pipeline creation and management, with significant interaction with a Supabase database and an Airflow system (likely for orchestrating data pipelines).

**`route.ts` (Airflow Proxy):**  This file underwent multiple revisions between 9:01:35 AM and 9:02:30 AM.  The key change was replacing the dynamic URL (`process.env.AIRFLOW_VM_URL`) with a hardcoded URL (`http://localhost:8080/api/v1`). This suggests a shift from a dynamically configured Airflow instance to a locally running instance at port 8080.

**`query.ts`:** This file contains numerous functions interacting with the Supabase database. Multiple revisions between 9:24:25 AM and 9:25:24 AM indicate debugging or refinement of the `createPipelineServer` function.  The added `console.log` statements in several versions suggest troubleshooting pipeline creation issues.  The functions consistently use Supabase's client to perform CRUD operations on various tables related to user data, pipelines, notebooks, workflows, and data sources. A recurring pattern is the use of `workspace_idv2` and `flow_project_idv2` suggesting a versioning or migration of workspace and project IDs.

**`usePipelineActions.ts` (Sync Pipelines):**  This file shows substantial changes between 9:26:41 AM and 9:37:49 AM, focusing on pipeline creation and deletion.  The `createPipelineSling` function was significantly revised to handle different source and target types (including file storage like S3) and to modify the target file name based on the date and pipeline name.  The function utilizes `createAirflowVariables` and `deleteAirflowVariables` for interacting with the Airflow system.  The handling of various database types (Postgres, Snowflake, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery) is also prominent, suggesting flexibility in data source/destination choices.  Added `console.log` statements throughout the code help in debugging, specifically logging pipeline data, errors, and array types.


**`PipelineDialogStepper.tsx`:**  This component manages the steps in a pipeline creation dialog. The code implements a stepper component with steps for source, destination, and configuration.  The state management includes handling various configuration options including `sourceConfig`, `destinationConfig`, and `loadConfig`, with different data types.  A key feature is the dynamic addition of an "Extraction" step based on the source type. The component interacts with the `usePipelineActions` hook for pipeline creation.

**`route.ts` (Salesforce OAuth Callback):** This file, updated at 8:42:39 AM, handles the Salesforce OAuth callback. It retrieves the authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL, then stores these in the Supabase `api_connections` table and sets corresponding cookies.  The response to the callback is an HTML page that communicates the success (or failure) of the connection back to the main application. The removal of an authentication check indicates that this function only deals with the OAuth flow and any authentication is handled elsewhere.

The overall pattern across these changes suggests ongoing development and refinement of the data pipeline creation and management features within the application.  The frequent updates, particularly in `query.ts` and `usePipelineActions.ts`, point to active debugging and integration work with Supabase and Airflow.
