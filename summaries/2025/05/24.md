# Activity Summary for 5/24/2025

## 9:39:31 AM
The log shows numerous code changes across several files within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` application.  The primary focus appears to be on data pipeline creation and management, with significant interaction with a Supabase database and an Airflow system (likely for orchestrating data pipelines).

**`route.ts` (Airflow Proxy):**  This file underwent multiple revisions between 9:01:35 AM and 9:02:30 AM.  The key change was replacing the dynamic URL (`process.env.AIRFLOW_VM_URL`) with a hardcoded URL (`http://localhost:8080/api/v1`). This suggests a shift from a dynamically configured Airflow instance to a locally running instance at port 8080.

**`query.ts`:** This file contains numerous functions interacting with the Supabase database. Multiple revisions between 9:24:25 AM and 9:25:24 AM indicate debugging or refinement of the `createPipelineServer` function.  The added `console.log` statements in several versions suggest troubleshooting pipeline creation issues.  The functions consistently use Supabase's client to perform CRUD operations on various tables related to user data, pipelines, notebooks, workflows, and data sources. A recurring pattern is the use of `workspace_idv2` and `flow_project_idv2` suggesting a versioning or migration of workspace and project IDs.

**`usePipelineActions.ts` (Sync Pipelines):**  This file shows substantial changes between 9:26:41 AM and 9:37:49 AM, focusing on pipeline creation and deletion.  The `createPipelineSling` function was significantly revised to handle different source and target types (including file storage like S3) and to modify the target file name based on the date and pipeline name.  The function utilizes `createAirflowVariables` and `deleteAirflowVariables` for interacting with the Airflow system.  The handling of various database types (Postgres, Snowflake, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery) is also prominent, suggesting flexibility in data source/destination choices.  Added `console.log` statements throughout the code help in debugging, specifically logging pipeline data, errors, and array types.


**`PipelineDialogStepper.tsx`:**  This component manages the steps in a pipeline creation dialog. The code implements a stepper component with steps for source, destination, and configuration.  The state management includes handling various configuration options including `sourceConfig`, `destinationConfig`, and `loadConfig`, with different data types.  A key feature is the dynamic addition of an "Extraction" step based on the source type. The component interacts with the `usePipelineActions` hook for pipeline creation.

**`route.ts` (Salesforce OAuth Callback):** This file, updated at 8:42:39 AM, handles the Salesforce OAuth callback. It retrieves the authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL, then stores these in the Supabase `api_connections` table and sets corresponding cookies.  The response to the callback is an HTML page that communicates the success (or failure) of the connection back to the main application. The removal of an authentication check indicates that this function only deals with the OAuth flow and any authentication is handled elsewhere.

The overall pattern across these changes suggests ongoing development and refinement of the data pipeline creation and management features within the application.  The frequent updates, particularly in `query.ts` and `usePipelineActions.ts`, point to active debugging and integration work with Supabase and Airflow.


## 10:39:26 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two files within a short time frame on May 24, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be on the `usePipelineActions.ts` file, which manages pipeline creation and deletion.  `query.ts`  undergoes changes related to database interactions, primarily using Supabase.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\edge-functions\components\usePipelineActions.ts`:**

This file contains numerous functions for interacting with pipelines:

* **`createPipeline`:** Creates a pipeline, handling Supabase interaction and Airflow variable creation.  Several revisions show debugging `console.log` statements added and removed, suggesting troubleshooting efforts.
* **`createPipelineSling`:**  A similar pipeline creation function, but seemingly designed for different source categories ('API', 'database', 'cloud') and handling file-based sources and targets differently.  This function also had debugging `console.log` statements that were eventually removed.
* **`deletePipeline`:** Deletes a pipeline, also managing interactions with Supabase and Airflow, and considering different pipeline types (Workflows, Edge Functions, SQL Notebooks).
* **`createDetails`, `createDatabaseUrl`, `createConnectionName`, `createAirflowVariables`, `setParentAirflowVariable`, `createChildAirflowVariable`:**  These are helper functions supporting pipeline creation and deletion.  They handle database URL construction, Airflow variable management, and details extraction from various database types.  The `createDetails` function shows a switch statement for handling different data source types (s3, redshift, salesforce, bigquery, mongodb).

The revisions to `usePipelineActions.ts` between 9:39:36 AM and 9:42:36 AM primarily involve adding `console.log` statements for debugging purposes, and then subsequently removing them once the issues were likely resolved.  This indicates iterative development and debugging.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\dbQueries\query.ts`:**

This file contains various functions for interacting with a Supabase database:

* Numerous functions (`getFlowProjects`, `updateWorkspaceTab`, `fetchWorkspaceNbsServer`, `checkExistingPyNotebook`, `createNewPyNotebook`, etc.) are dedicated to managing various aspects of the application's data, such as retrieving workspace information, notebooks, edge functions, and workflows, as well as creating and updating entries.  These functions all use a consistent pattern of fetching data from Supabase tables.
* `createPipelineServer`, `deletePipelineForWorkflow`, `deletePipelineForEdge`, `deletePipelineForSqlNotebook`, and `deletePipelineServer`: handle pipeline related Supabase operations.  The `createPipelineServer` function also saw debugging statements added and then removed in later revisions.  The deletion functions seem to update the `dag_id` field to null, possibly indicating a decoupling of the pipeline from its Airflow DAG.

The revision at 9:43:34 AM shows a complete set of Supabase interaction functions for different parts of the application.  There's a clear pattern of using Supabase's client to interact with various tables (`autonomis_user_flow_projectv2`, `autonomis_user_py_notebook`, `autonomis_user_edge_functions`, etc.).

In summary, the code changes reflect active development and debugging, focused on pipeline management functionality, leveraging Supabase for database interactions, and Airflow for task orchestration.  The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development and debugging of the pipeline creation and deletion processes.


## 12:39:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the file `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts` between 12:02 PM and 12:05 PM on May 24, 2025.  The file is a Next.js API route handling the Salesforce OAuth callback.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: it receives an authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL from Salesforce using `axios`, stores these tokens in a Supabase database (`api_connections` table), sets corresponding HTTP-only cookies (`sf_access_token`, `sf_refresh_token`, `sf_instance_url`), and returns an HTML page that communicates the success or failure of the connection to the parent window via `postMessage`.

The main changes between revisions involve the destructuring of the `tokenResponse.data` object. Initially, only `access_token`, `instance_url`, and `refresh_token` were extracted. Subsequent revisions added `user_id` and finally `organization_id`, suggesting a progressive refinement to capture more information from the Salesforce OAuth response.  These changes happened rapidly, between 12:04 PM and 12:05 PM.  There were no other significant functional changes to the code.


## 1:39:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of two files: `route.ts` and `query.ts`.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts`:** This file underwent several revisions between 12:58 PM and 1:38 PM on May 24, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent:  it handles the Salesforce OAuth callback, exchanges an authorization code for access and refresh tokens, stores these tokens in a Supabase database (`autonmis_api_providers_table`), sets cookies for these tokens, and then returns an HTML page to communicate success (or failure) to the calling window.

The primary changes across revisions involved logging statements (adding `console.log` for debugging purposes,  specifically logging the result of the Supabase upsert operation, and refining the logging message for successful token insertion) and a minor code cleanup (removing unnecessary comma). One version briefly had a typographical error (`console.log(us)` instead of `console.log(user)`). The core logic of the OAuth flow, token storage, and cookie setting remained unchanged.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\edge-functions\dbQueries\query.ts`:** This file contains numerous functions for interacting with a Supabase database.  All functions use the `createClient` function to establish a Supabase client and perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on several tables including  `autonomis_user_flow_projectv2`, `autonomis_user_edge_functions`,  `autonomis_user_notebook`, and others.  Each function is designed to fetch, update, or delete specific data related to workflows, edge functions, notebooks, and pipelines based on ID or other criteria. There are no modifications recorded in the provided log for this file.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\dbQueries\query.ts`:** This file, similar to `query.ts` in the `edge-functions` directory, also contains multiple functions for interacting with the Supabase database. It features numerous functions for creating, updating, and retrieving data related to Python notebooks, edge functions, workflows, and data sources.  The changes occurred between 1:14 PM and 1:21 PM on May 24, 2025.  The key change was removing the `extraction_config` field from the `pipelineData` object before inserting it into the `autonomis_user_ingestion_pipeline` table in the `createPipelineServer` function.  This suggests a refactoring to handle the `extraction_config` differently. There were also some minor updates to logging statements. The overall structure and functionality of the Supabase database interactions remained the same.

The recurring theme throughout both files is heavy reliance on Supabase for data persistence and management.  The functions are concise and focused on specific database operations.


## 2:39:24 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `route.ts` file responsible for handling Salesforce OAuth callbacks and the `user.ts` file which handles user data retrieval.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts` file:**

The primary changes in `route.ts`  center around the commented-out `supabase.from('autonmis_api_providers_table').upsert(...)` function. Initially, this function was used to store Salesforce tokens in a Supabase table.  It was subsequently commented out in multiple revisions between 1:52:02 PM and 1:53:44 PM.  Throughout the edits, there's a consistent pattern of logging user and token data (`userId`, `organization_id`, `user_id`, `access_token`, `instance_url`, `refresh_token`) to the console.  The final version (1:58:52 PM) includes additional logging messages, suggesting debugging efforts. The code retrieves and stores Salesforce access and refresh tokens in cookies and sends a message to the opener window indicating success or failure.

**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\home\HomeWrapper.tsx` file:**

This file, modified at 2:00:49 PM, is a React component responsible for rendering the home page.  It includes functions to generate dummy data (notebooks, dashboards, metrics) for new users. The `generateDummyItems` function interacts with various server functions (`fetchDummyConnectorsServer`, `createUserDummyDatabaseServer`, etc.) to populate the user's account with sample data.  It uses UUIDs to generate unique IDs for dummy items. This component utilizes a loading state (`isLoading`) to provide feedback while fetching user data and generating dummy items.


**`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\lib\user.ts` file:**

The `user.ts` file, updated multiple times between 2:03:29 PM and 2:07:18 PM, contains functions for retrieving user data from Supabase.  The `getAutonomisUser` function retrieves user information, including their product plan, and checks if they've completed the warehouse selection step (if not on the 'Free Tier' plan).  The added logging statements ("checking if i am getting this use", "checking if i am getting this user.user data", "user.user is calling") between revisions strongly suggest debugging attempts to understand if the function is correctly retrieving the user data. The `getUserById` function fetches a user by ID.  The changes are primarily focused on debugging and refining the user data retrieval logic, particularly handling cases where user data is missing or incomplete.


## 3:39:20 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `user.ts` and `route.ts`.

`user.ts` (multiple updates between 2:55:14 PM and 2:55:34 PM):  This file contains functions related to user authentication and data retrieval.  The `getAutonomisUser` function retrieves user information from a Supabase database, including product plans and onboarding data.  It redirects the user to `/login`, `/info`, or `/connect-warehouse` based on their authentication status and data completeness.  Minor changes were made to the logging statements within the `try` block across the three commits, changing the message from "inside of tryca" to "inside of trycatch block". The `getUserById` function retrieves a user by ID.  All updates to this file seem to be focused on debugging and improving logging.


`route.ts` (update at 3:10:39 PM): This file handles the Salesforce OAuth callback. It exchanges an authorization code for access and refresh tokens using the Salesforce OAuth 2.0 API. The obtained tokens, along with user and organization IDs, are logged, but there is commented-out code suggesting they were originally intended to be stored in a `autonmis_api_providers_table` in the Supabase database.  Instead of direct database interaction, the tokens are now stored in HTTPOnly cookies (`sf_access_token`, `sf_refresh_token`, `sf_instance_url`). The response to the callback is an HTML page that indicates success or failure and sends a message to the opening window using `postMessage`.  This suggests a shift towards cookie-based token storage for Salesforce authentication.


## 5:39:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts` between 5:31:47 PM and 5:32:05 PM on 5/24/2025, and one revision of `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\lib\user.ts` at 5:31:24 PM on the same day.

The `user.ts` file contains functions for retrieving user information from a Supabase database.  `getAutonomisUser` retrieves user data, including product plan information, and redirects based on onboarding status. `getUserById` retrieves user data by ID.


The `route.ts` file handles the Salesforce OAuth callback.  The key changes across its multiple revisions involve the handling of the `userId` variable. Initially,  the `userId` was attempted to be assigned directly from `user` data retrieved from `getAutonomisUser`, then it was changed to retrieve the  `userId` from Supabase authentication using `supabase.auth.getUser()`. This ensures the correct user ID is used even if `getAutonomisUser` does not provide the ID.  The Supabase upsert operation to store Salesforce tokens was consistently commented out across the revisions, suggesting a possible change in implementation strategy.  The file uses axios to exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens, stores these tokens in cookies, and returns an HTML response indicating success or failure of the connection.  The HTML response uses postMessage to communicate the connection status back to the parent window.


## 6:39:21 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of two files: `route.ts` and `user.ts`.  The `route.ts` file manages Salesforce OAuth callbacks.  The primary functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions: it retrieves an authorization code, exchanges it for Salesforce tokens (access_token, refresh_token, instance_url), and then sets these tokens as HTTPOnly cookies.  A crucial change between the first and subsequent versions of `route.ts` involves correcting the way user data is handled. Initially, there was an attempt to use  `data` directly from `getAutonomisUser`, which was later refined to utilize `data: user` clarifying the data source and assignment to the user variable.  There were also a few minor changes in log statements, adding a "after getting token..." message.  The Supabase upsert operation for storing tokens remains commented out in all revisions.  All changes to `route.ts` occurred within a short timeframe (approximately 30 minutes on May 24, 2025).


The `user.ts` file, modified twice on May 24, 2025, between 6:26 PM and 6:33 PM, contains a function `getAutonomisUser` that retrieves user information from Supabase's `autonomis_user_registration` table.  This function checks for warehouse selection based on the user's product plan.  If the plan is not 'Free Tier', and warehouse information is missing, it redirects to the '/connect-warehouse' route. The only functional change introduced in the last revision is the addition of a `console.log(data[0])` statement.  The structure and functionality of `getUserById` remain unchanged throughout the log.


## 7:39:27 PM
The log shows multiple updates to several files within the `atnms-mono-datapipe` project.  The primary focus is on integrating various third-party applications (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4, and Airtable) for data pipeline purposes.

`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\test-connection\route.ts` underwent several revisions between 6:59 PM and 7:15 PM.  These changes primarily involved minor modifications to logging statements and no significant alterations to the core functionality of testing connections to different applications.  The file uses a switch statement to handle different third-party applications, fetching access tokens from cookies and making API calls accordingly.  Error handling is consistent across all cases, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.

`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\lib\user.ts` was updated twice, between 7:01 PM and 7:01:42 PM.  The key change is the removal of a `console.log` statement in the `getAutonomisUser` function, suggesting a cleanup or optimization step. The function retrieves user data from a Supabase database, and performs checks for warehouse selection based on the user's product plan.

`c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\apiConnect\oauth\callback\salesforce\route.ts` received extensive modifications between 7:02 PM and 7:23 PM. The most significant changes were:

*   **Extracting Org and User IDs from Salesforce:** Initially, the code directly used user data from the session.  Later versions extracted the organization ID and user ID from the `id_url` field in the Salesforce token response, by parsing the URL.  
*   **Supabase Integration:**  The code initially contained commented-out code to upsert Salesforce tokens into a Supabase table (`autonmis_api_providers_table`).  This was subsequently uncommented and implemented at 7:22 PM, storing the tokens, user IDs, and organization IDs persistently.
*   **Hardcoded User ID:** The `userId` variable was initially dynamically fetched from Supabase but was eventually hardcoded to `231`. This may be a temporary solution for testing or debugging.

The repeated updates to the Salesforce callback route indicate iterative development and debugging focused on handling the token response and persistent storage of authentication details.  The overall pattern across all files is a consistent use of cookies for storing access and refresh tokens, Axios for making API calls to third-party services, and Supabase for user management and data persistence.  The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development and debugging around Salesforce integration, followed by refinements to the connection testing functionality.


## 8:39:19 PM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\api\extractors\config\route.ts`, both on May 24, 2025.  The changes between the two revisions are minor. The first revision (7:45:42 PM) includes a `console.log("extraction con")` statement. The second revision (7:46:06 PM), made only a minute later, refines this log statement to `console.log("extraction config details", pipeline_id, config)`,  providing more context by logging the `pipeline_id` and `config` variables.  Both revisions define API routes (POST and GET) that interact with a Supabase database (`autonomis_bapps_extraction_config`) to manage extraction configurations.  The code handles authentication, input validation, data insertion and retrieval, and error handling.  The GET route specifically retrieves the latest config for a given pipeline ID and user, handling cases where no data is found.  The code consistently uses `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` from the `next/server` library and leverages Supabase's client library for database interactions.
