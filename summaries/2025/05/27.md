# Activity Summary for 5/27/2025

## 12:19:06 PM
The log shows code changes across two files on May 27, 2025.

**`route.ts` (11:19:36 AM):** This file handles Salesforce OAuth callbacks.  The code exchanges an authorization code for an access token, refresh token, and instance URL.  It then stores these tokens in cookies and, importantly, attempts to upsert them into a `autonmis_api_providers_table` database.  A significant portion of the code (commented out) appears to be related to user identification using Supabase authentication, but this functionality is currently inactive. The code also generates HTML responses indicating success or failure, using `postMessage` to communicate with the calling window.  Error handling is included to catch issues during token exchange and database interaction.  Hardcoded client ID and secret values are present, raising a security concern if not changed in a production environment.


**`dbconnection.tsx` (11:19:43 AM):** This React component manages database connections, focusing on APIs and databases.  It handles testing connections (using `/api/apiConnect/test-connection` and `/api/testconnection` endpoints), polling for connection status, and saving connection details using an `onSubmit` function. The component supports various data sources (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4, Airtable, and Mixpanel) each with its unique authentication logic; some utilize OAuth, others require credentials.  The component also fetches data field details using `getDataSourceDetail` and handles form state, validation and error messaging.  The code displays a loader while testing connections.  The method for authentication varies across different APIs.  Environment variables are used for some APIs (HubSpot, Zoho, Google Analytics 4), but hardcoded values are also used in some cases (Salesforce).  The Mixpanel API uses a POST request to `/api/apiConnect/oauth/callback/mixpanel`.


**`route.ts` (11:44:40 AM):**  This file defines API routes for managing extraction configurations. The POST route creates a new extraction configuration, storing it in the `autonomis_bapps_extraction_config` table in Supabase. It requires authentication and includes error handling. The GET route retrieves an existing extraction configuration based on `pipeline_id` and authenticated user, returning `null` if no configuration is found. Both routes use Supabase client for database interaction and implement robust error handling.

**Recurring Elements:**  Both `route.ts` files (the OAuth callback and the extractor config routes) utilize the `createSupbaseServerClient` function for database interaction, highlighting a consistent reliance on Supabase for data persistence.  Both also contain thorough error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes in their responses.  The use of hardcoded client credentials is a recurring issue that needs addressing in the production environment.


## 6:49:10 PM
The log shows two edits to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\autonomis\atnms-mono-datapipe\app\sync-pipelines\page.tsx`, both within a minute of each other (6:17 PM on 5/27/2025).  The only difference between the two versions is a minor change in the `<h1>` tag within the JSX. The initial version displayed "Data Pipelines hello", which was subsequently updated to "Data Pipelines" by removing the " hello".  The rest of the code, including the fetching of user data using `getAutonomisUser` and `createSupbaseServerClient`, interaction with a Supabase database table (`autonomis_user_ingestion_pipeline`), and rendering using components like `Sidebar` and `PipelinePageWrapper`, remained unchanged.
