# Activity Summary for 1/14/2025

## 4:26:37 PM
The log shows multiple edits to the `vercel.json` file within a short time frame (approximately 21 minutes on January 14th, 2025).  The primary changes involve the `src` and `dest` properties within the `builds` and `routes` arrays, respectively.  Initially, the build source was incorrectly set to `src/index.ts`, then changed to `dis/index.ts` (likely a typo), corrected to `dist/index.js`, and finally reverted back to `src/index.ts`.  The destination for routes followed a similar pattern, mirroring the changes in the build source. This suggests the developer was experimenting with build configurations, possibly correcting a typo and ultimately settling on using `src/index.ts` as both the build source and route destination.  The `version` and `use` properties remained constant at `2` and `"@vercel/node"` throughout the edits.
