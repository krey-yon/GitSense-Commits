# Activity Summary for 1/27/2025

## 4:02:13 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `PageOne.tsx` on January 27th, 2025, between approximately 3:03 PM and 3:19 PM.  The main focus of the changes was styling and adding functionality to the component.

Initially, the component consisted of a heading, a paragraph, and an image.  The first few edits focused on modifying the heading's style, increasing the font size (`text-4xl` to `text-6xl`) and changing the font weight (`font-bold` to `font-extrabold`).  A margin was also added (`mb-6`).

Around 3:07 PM, two buttons were added:  One labeled "Learn More" and another that underwent several iterations before settling on "Get started". These changes involved modifying button text and applying styling attributes like background color (`bg-green-500`), padding (`p-2`), rounded corners (`rounded-md`), text size (`text-sm`, `text-base`), and text color (`text-black`).

Between 3:11 PM and 3:12 PM, an arrow icon (`IoIosArrowForward` from `react-icons/io`) was added to the "Get started" button. Further refinements involved adjusting the icon's positioning and styling within the button using `inline-flex` and `gap-2`.

Finally,  from 3:14 PM to 3:19 PM, the styling of the "Learn More" button was refined, adding a transparent background (`bg-transparent`), a border (`border-green-500`), and ensuring consistent padding and text size with the "Get started" button.  The final version uses a green border and text color for the "Learn More" button.  The overall change pattern indicates iterative design and styling adjustments for the component.
