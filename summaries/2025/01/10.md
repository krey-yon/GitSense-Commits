# Activity Summary for 1/10/2025

## 5:09:16 PM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\del latet python\main.py` at 1/10/2025, 4:10:15 PM.  This change introduces a FastAPI application endpoint (`/remove-background/`) that accepts an image upload (`file: UploadFile`). The endpoint uses the `rembg` library to remove the image's background and then returns the processed image as a streaming PNG response.  The code directly handles image reading, background removal, and streaming the output. There are no recurring elements or patterns beyond the core functionality of image background removal within a single file.
