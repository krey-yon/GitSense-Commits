# Activity Summary for 1/22/2025

## 6:37:16 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to `PageOne.tsx` between 5:40 PM and 6:10 PM on January 22, 2025, primarily focusing on styling and adding interactive elements.  Initially, the page contained only a header, paragraph, and hero image.  Subsequent changes introduced "Install Now" and "Learn More" buttons, iteratively refining their styling with additions of classes for rounded corners, background color, padding, text color, and size.  Around 5:50 PM, a right arrow icon (`FaArrowRightLong`) was integrated into the "Install Now" button.  Further changes involved adjusting the spacing between the buttons and the container using `space-x-4` and `mt-8` classes.

Between 6:02 PM and 6:10 PM, the focus shifted to the overall layout of `PageOne.tsx`.  The `flex-wrap` and `overflow-auto` classes were added to handle content overflow and responsiveness across different screen sizes. The `max-width` of the text content container was adjusted.  Finally, the width of the image container was tweaked to resolve layout issues using `max-w-[calc(100%-28px)]`, replacing the previous `w-[full-28px]` and `w-[full-28px]` attempts.  The heading's font size was also reduced from `text-[2.75rem]` to `text-[2rem]`.


The `Navbar.tsx` component was modified between 5:59 PM and 6:00 PM. These changes primarily focused on adjusting padding and spacing within the navigation bar.  Specifically, padding (`px`) and gap (`gap`) were added or modified to improve the layout of the navigation elements.  The gap between the navigation list items was increased from `gap-4` to `gap-8`. Padding was added to the logo and buttons to better control spacing.


## 7:37:14 PM
The log shows modifications to React components within a `supermetrics-fe` application.  The primary focus is on `PageOne.tsx`, which underwent several revisions between 7:13:00 PM and 7:13:31 PM on January 22nd, 2025.  These changes primarily involved styling adjustments to the component's layout.  Specifically, the `pt` (padding-top) property of the main div was iteratively refined, eventually settling on `pt-8` for the mobile layout and `md:pt-28` for medium screens and above.  The content of `PageOne.tsx` remained largely consistent, displaying a hero section with a Google Workspace integration theme, along with "Install Now" and "Learn More" buttons.

At 7:29:26 PM, a simple `PageTwo.tsx` component was created.  Finally, at 7:29:42 PM, a main application component (`page.tsx`) was updated to render both `PageOne` and `PageTwo` components.  No other files were modified in this log.
