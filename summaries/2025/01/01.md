No other files were modified according to this log entry.


## 9:23:54 PM
The log shows development activity across client and server components of a project named "NoBg" on January 1st, 2025.

**Client-side changes:** A single modification occurred at 8:24:33 PM to `Navbar.tsx`. This update integrated Clerk.js for user authentication, adding a `UserButton` for signed-in users and a "Get Started" button to initiate the sign-in flow for unsigned-in users.

**Server-side changes:**  The majority of the activity focused on the server.  The `package.json` file underwent several revisions.  Initially, it contained only basic metadata.  At 8:33:22 PM, dependencies were added, including `express`, `mongoose`, `cors`, `axios`, and several others, indicating the setup of a backend API using Express.js and MongoDB. A `dev` script was added using nodemon at 8:41:04PM.   At 8:38:07 PM, a `.env` file was created to manage environment variables, primarily the `PORT` setting initially set to 3000. The `MONGO_URI` variable was then added and refined until 9:03:18 PM to include a MongoDB connection string (mongodb+srv://kreyon:vikas9899@kreyondb.hmexu.mongodb.net/).

The `index.js` file (server entry point) saw a series of incremental changes, starting from an empty file and gradually evolving to include:
    - importing required modules (`express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `connectDb`)
    - setting up middleware (`express.json()`, `cors()`)
    - establishing a basic route (`/`) to test API functionality
    - starting the server and listening on a defined port. The server is connected to mongodb at 9:02:39PM.

A `mongodb.js` configuration file was created to handle MongoDB connection.  This file went through several revisions, primarily focusing on error handling and logging around the connection status and initial connection setup. The final version uses the `MONGO_URI` from the `.env` file and logs connection status.

Finally, a `userModel.js` file was added at around 9:05 PM to define a MongoDB schema for users, containing `clerkId`, `email`, `photo`, `firstName`, and `lastName` fields. A `UserControllers.js` file was also started.

In summary, the log documents the initial setup of a backend API using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, which is designed to interact with a frontend using Clerk.js for authentication. The development process was iterative, with frequent small commits showing a steady build-out of server-side functionality.
