# Activity Summary for 1/23/2025

## 6:59:58 PM
The log shows a series of edits to two files: `TrustedCompnay.tsx` and `PageTwo.tsx`.

**`TrustedCompnay.tsx`**: This component underwent a significant restructuring between the first four entries (6:11 PM - 6:15 PM) and the final entry at 6:33 PM.  Initially, the component displayed a section with a grid graphic and an image of several company logos. The initial changes focused on adjusting the section's dimensions (`w-[1440px] h-[284px]` changed to `w-full h-full`), while the image remained.  Finally, the component was completely rewritten, replacing the image and grid with a different design featuring multiple individual company logos arranged in a flexbox layout, surrounded by decorative corner images.  This last version uses only img tags. The `img` component was changed to `Img` and then back to `img` in the updates from 6:14 PM to 6:15 PM.


**`PageTwo.tsx`**: This file, initially blank,  was populated at 6:34 PM  with a layout very similar to the final version of `TrustedCompnay.tsx`, featuring multiple company logos, decorative corner images, and consistent styling.  Subsequent edits (6:34 PM - 6:42 PM) focused on refining the code, primarily changing from `class` to `className` attributes in the JSX, consistent with React conventions. The initial change was a typo in `classNae` corrected to `className` in subsequent commits.  Around 6:40 PM, the `img` tag was replaced with the `next/image` component (`Image`) for most (but not all) image elements. There was a failed attempt to directly use a path in the `Image` component at 6:41 PM before being corrected to the right path.  These edits suggest a move towards optimized image handling with Next.js's `Image` component.

In summary, the code evolution involved:

*   A major redesign of the `TrustedCompnay` component, moving from a single logo image to a multi-logo layout.
*   The creation of `PageTwo.tsx`, heavily mirroring the updated design in `TrustedCompnay.tsx`.
*   A consistent pattern of correcting class names to className throughout `PageTwo.tsx`.
*   A transition to `next/image` for more efficient image rendering in `PageTwo.tsx`.
*   Numerous minor corrections and refinements throughout the log spanning approximately one hour.
