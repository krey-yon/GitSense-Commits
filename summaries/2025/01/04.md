# Activity Summary for 1/4/2025

## 4:54:32 PM
The log shows a single entry updating the `.env` file in a project located at `c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NoBg\client`.  The update, made on January 4th, 2025 at 3:57:23 PM,  sets two environment variables: `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to a Clerk.dev publishable key (appears to be a test key) and `VITE_BACKEND_URL` to a local development server address (`http://localhost:3000/`).  This suggests configuration changes for connecting a frontend client (likely using Vite) to a backend service and a third-party authentication provider (Clerk).
