# Activity Summary for 1/31/2025

## 9:05:07 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `BubbleChart.tsx` and `BubbleChart2.tsx`.  Both components render bubble charts, but they differ significantly in their layout and positioning algorithms.

**BubbleChart.tsx:** This component underwent several iterations focused on bubble positioning.  Initial attempts (8:12:26 PM and 8:14:06 PM) used a random placement algorithm with collision detection, adjusting parameters like container size and maximum attempts to improve bubble distribution.  A later revision (8:21:21 PM) simplified positioning, calculating positions based on volume and percent change, adding small offsets to prevent overlaps.  Subsequent changes (8:24:22 PM, 8:27:09 PM, 8:29:47 PM, and 8:29:58 PM) reverted to earlier versions or made minor UI adjustments, primarily toggling the visibility of risk zone indicators and labels.


**BubbleChart2.tsx:** This component displays a chart where bubbles are positioned based on their risk level (vertical) and a randomized horizontal position with collision detection.  The initial version (8:31:58 PM) included data fetching from a remote server ("http://3.75.231.25/dex_risks"), handling loading and error states, and implemented basic collision detection.  Over several iterations (8:32:33 PM to 8:42:10 PM), the positioning algorithm was refined to improve bubble distribution and handle different numbers of data points, involving adjustments to margins, minimum distances, and iterative collision resolution. From 8:54:48 PM onwards, the focus shifted towards positioning bubbles based on their risk value along both the x and y axes, introducing an iterative adjustment process to resolve overlaps more effectively.  The number of iterations in the collision avoidance loop was also increased to 15 (8:56:11 PM and 8:57:33 PM). Finally, at 9:04:08 PM, a significantly different positioning approach was adopted.  This version uses a simpler method placing bubbles based on their risk and then uses a `do...while` loop for collision detection, limiting the number of attempts to prevent infinite loops.  The vertical and horizontal positions both contain a random element that is bounded by `Math.random()*50 - 25`, adding a more uniform distribution.

In summary, the changes in both files center around optimizing bubble chart layouts and improving the efficiency and robustness of bubble positioning algorithms.  `BubbleChart.tsx` focused on randomized positioning with collision detection, while `BubbleChart2.tsx` evolved towards risk-based vertical positioning with increasingly sophisticated horizontal arrangement and collision resolution.  The final version of `BubbleChart2.tsx` provides the most efficient solution.
