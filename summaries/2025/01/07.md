# Activity Summary for 1/7/2025

## 6:44:17 PM
The log shows edits to a single C++ file, `money.cpp`, located in a Next.js project.  All changes were made on January 7th, 2025, within a short timeframe (approximately 20 minutes).

The file initially contained a basic `main` function with no content.  At 6:35:42 PM, a variable `money` was initialized to 1330.  No further changes were made to this variable's value.  At 6:36:40 PM, an array `bills` containing integer denominations (100, 50, 10, 5, 1) was added. Finally, at 6:36:55 PM, a loop was implemented to calculate how many bills of each denomination are needed to represent the value of `money`. This suggests the code is designed to perform a currency breakdown calculation.  The key change occurred between 6:36:40 PM and 6:36:55 PM, where the algorithm for the bill calculation was added.
