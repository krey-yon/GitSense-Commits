# Activity Summary for 1/8/2025

## 2:17:27 PM
The log details the development of a Node.js server that summarizes YouTube video transcripts using Google's Gemini AI.  The primary file, `index.js`, underwent numerous revisions between 1:18 PM and 1:39 PM on January 8th, 2025.

Initially, the code fetched a YouTube transcript and directly passed it to the Gemini API for summarization.  Early changes focused on data cleaning: removing non-alphanumeric characters from the transcript text using `replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g, '')`.  There were also several debugging attempts involving `console.log` statements to inspect intermediate variables (`transcriptDataText`, `response`, etc.), showing adjustments to variable names and attempts to access the response data in different ways.

Around 1:25 PM, a `.env` file was added and modified, introducing API keys for YouTube Data API v3 and two Gemini API keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY2`).  The `index.js` file was subsequently updated to use `GEMINI_API_KEY2`.

Significant changes to `index.js` involved refining the handling of the Gemini API response. The initial attempts to access the summarized text failed due to inconsistencies in the response structure. The code evolved through various attempts to access the summarized text, finally settling on `response.response.candidates[0].text` by 1:36 PM.

Furthermore, the `generateText` function was modified.  Initially it only took a `prompt` parameter, then it added error handling, then it attempted to clean the prompt itself using the same regular expression used for cleaning the transcript. A default prompt was also temporarily added before being removed.

By the end of the log, the server successfully fetches a YouTube transcript, cleans it, sends it to the Gemini API with a "Summarize this text" prompt, and extracts the summarized text from the complex API response, printing it to the console. The final version improves the prompt formatting by adding a space between the prompt and the transcript text.


## 4:08:20 PM
The log shows the development of a binary search function in C++.  The file `c:\Users\user\DSA-main\BinarySearch\binarysearch.cpp` was modified three times on January 8th, 2025.

The first change (3:08:52 PM) created a basic file with only a `main` function returning 0.

The second change (3:09:10 PM) added the `binarySearch` function itself, implementing a standard iterative binary search algorithm.

The final change (3:09:37 PM) added a `main` function that tests the `binarySearch` function with two sample arrays, one even-sized and one odd-sized, searching for specific keys (6 and 14 respectively) and printing the results to the console.  Note there is a redundant `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function.  All changes were focused on this single file.
