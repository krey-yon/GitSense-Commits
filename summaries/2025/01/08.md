# Activity Summary for 1/8/2025

## 2:17:27 PM
The log details the development of a Node.js server that summarizes YouTube video transcripts using Google's Gemini AI.  The primary file, `index.js`, underwent numerous revisions between 1:18 PM and 1:39 PM on January 8th, 2025.

Initially, the code fetched a YouTube transcript and directly passed it to the Gemini API for summarization.  Early changes focused on data cleaning: removing non-alphanumeric characters from the transcript text using `replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g, '')`.  There were also several debugging attempts involving `console.log` statements to inspect intermediate variables (`transcriptDataText`, `response`, etc.), showing adjustments to variable names and attempts to access the response data in different ways.

Around 1:25 PM, a `.env` file was added and modified, introducing API keys for YouTube Data API v3 and two Gemini API keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY2`).  The `index.js` file was subsequently updated to use `GEMINI_API_KEY2`.

Significant changes to `index.js` involved refining the handling of the Gemini API response. The initial attempts to access the summarized text failed due to inconsistencies in the response structure. The code evolved through various attempts to access the summarized text, finally settling on `response.response.candidates[0].text` by 1:36 PM.

Furthermore, the `generateText` function was modified.  Initially it only took a `prompt` parameter, then it added error handling, then it attempted to clean the prompt itself using the same regular expression used for cleaning the transcript. A default prompt was also temporarily added before being removed.

By the end of the log, the server successfully fetches a YouTube transcript, cleans it, sends it to the Gemini API with a "Summarize this text" prompt, and extracts the summarized text from the complex API response, printing it to the console. The final version improves the prompt formatting by adding a space between the prompt and the transcript text.


## 4:08:20 PM
The log shows the development of a binary search function in C++.  The file `c:\Users\user\DSA-main\BinarySearch\binarysearch.cpp` was modified three times on January 8th, 2025.

The first change (3:08:52 PM) created a basic file with only a `main` function returning 0.

The second change (3:09:10 PM) added the `binarySearch` function itself, implementing a standard iterative binary search algorithm.

The final change (3:09:37 PM) added a `main` function that tests the `binarySearch` function with two sample arrays, one even-sized and one odd-sized, searching for specific keys (6 and 14 respectively) and printing the results to the console.  Note there is a redundant `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function.  All changes were focused on this single file.


## 8:05:40 PM
The log shows a single file, `c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NextJs\youbrief\server\index.js`, undergoing numerous revisions between 7:05 PM and 7:11 PM on January 8th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: fetching a YouTube transcript using the `YoutubeTranscript` library, processing it to extract text, and then using the `GoogleGenerativeAI` library (specifically the "gemini-1.5-flash" model) to summarize the transcript.

Early revisions (7:05 PM - 7:06 PM) involved debugging and refining the transcript fetching and processing.  The initial code contained commented-out sections showing an attempt to summarize the text using a `generateText` function, which was later removed. Significant changes involved correctly awaiting the `YoutubeTranscript.fetchTranscript` promise (around 7:06 PM).

Between 7:06 PM and 7:09 PM, the focus shifted to correctly concatenating the transcript text into `transcriptDataText`.  Initially, there were errors in how the `forEach` loop and `map` function were used to accumulate the text.  By 7:09 PM, the `map` function was correctly used to build `rawCaptions`, containing all the transcript text.

The final changes (7:09 PM - 7:11 PM) involved constructing the prompt for the Google Gemini AI model.  The prompt was refined to correctly incorporate the `rawCaptions` variable, resulting in the successful summarization of the YouTube transcript.  The `console.log` statements were adjusted to output only the final summary.  The unnecessary `transcriptDataText` variable was also removed in the final version.  The final code efficiently fetches the transcript, concatenates the text, creates the prompt and finally summarizes the transcript using the Gemini AI model.


## 9:05:40 PM
The log shows modifications to `c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NextJs\youbrief\server\index.js` between 8:19 PM and 8:20 PM on January 8th, 2025.  The file uses the Google Gemini API (`gemini-1.5-flash`) to summarize YouTube video transcripts.

The key changes involve the prompt sent to the Google Generative AI model. Initially, the prompt was simply "Summarize this text," then it evolved to "Summarize this youtube video," and finally included specific YouTube video URLs.  The initial attempts did not utilize the extracted captions.

Specifically:

* **8:19:28 PM:** The script fetches a transcript from a specific YouTube video (`https://youtu.be/oVa8DfUDKTw?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA`) and attempts to summarize it using a generic prompt.
* **8:19:34 PM:** The prompt is updated to "Summarize this youtube video,"  still using the same initial video.
* **8:19:39 PM:** A different YouTube video URL (`https://youtu.be/d13np978-ko?list=RDGMEMWO-g6DgCWEqKlDtKbJA1Gw`) is used in the prompt.
* **8:20:28 PM:** Yet another YouTube video URL (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqcGi0vUtkM`) is used.
* **8:20:54 PM:** The script reverts to using the captions extracted from the original video (`https://youtu.be/oVa8DfUDKTw?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA`) and uses them within the prompt:  `"Summarize this text ${rawCaptions}"`.


The recurring pattern is experimentation with different prompts to improve the summarization process.  The core functionality of fetching transcripts and using the Google Generative AI remains consistent throughout.
