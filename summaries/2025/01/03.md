# Activity Summary for 1/3/2025

## 9:13:36 PM
The log shows development of a background removal API and its client-side integration.  Between 8:19 PM and 8:21 PM, `imageRoutes.js` was modified to define a POST endpoint (`/remove-bg`) that uses middleware for authentication (`authUser`), file upload (`upload.single('image')`), and the background removal function (`removebg`). The route path was initially `/removebg` and then changed to `/remove-bg`.

Simultaneously, `index.js` was updated (8:22 PM - 8:22:36 PM) to integrate this new route into the server by adding `app.use('/api/image', imageRouter);`.  This involved importing `imageRouter` and adding the necessary middleware to handle image routes.

The `imageControllers.js` file underwent significant changes (8:23 PM - 8:38 PM).  Initially, a basic `removeBg` function was created. This was subsequently expanded to: 
1. Retrieve `clerkId` from the request body to authenticate the user.
2.  Find the user using the `clerkId` and handle user not found errors (404).
3. Access the uploaded image path.
4. Read the image file using `fs.createReadStream`.
5. Create a FormData object to send the image to the background removal API (`https://clipdrop-api.co/remove-background/v1`).
6.  This required adding the `x-api-key` header using the `CLIPDROP_API` environment variable.
7. Set the `responseType` to `'arraybuffer'` to receive the image data as a buffer.
8. Convert the received image data into a base64 string.
9.  Finally, send the base64 encoded image back to the client within a JSON response.


The client-side code (`AppContext.tsx`), modified between 8:39 PM and 9:08 PM, reflects the API changes.   The primary changes involved the `removebg` function, which originally just navigated to a result page.  It was updated to make a POST request to the `/api/image/remove-bg` endpoint using `axios`.  Authorization was added using a `Bearer` token obtained via `useAuth` from the Clerk.js library.  Error handling and a state update to store the result (`resultImage`) were also implemented, alongside ensuring type safety of `image` and related state variables. There were numerous minor edits throughout this time.

Finally, `Result.tsx` (8:50 PM - 9:08 PM) was adjusted to display the original and background-removed images using the values from `AppContext`.  The download functionality for the processed image was implemented, using conditional rendering to show a loading spinner until the processed image is available.  The Placeholder images `imagewb.png` and `imagewithoutbg.png` were replaced with dynamic sources.

In summary, the codebase represents a functional background removal service. The development focused on integrating authentication, file uploading, background removal using a third-party API, and presenting the result to the user, all within a React application.  The API is built using Express.js and MongoDB.
