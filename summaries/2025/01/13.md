# Activity Summary for 1/13/2025

## 7:36:04 PM
The log shows development of a Node.js server using Express.js, TypeScript, and Google's Gemini API for generating summaries of YouTube video transcripts.

**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NextJs\youbrief\client\src\app\page.tsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 6:46 PM and 6:47 PM.  The initial version included Next.js styling and a `div` element with specific grid properties.  Subsequent changes progressively removed these styles and ultimately resulted in a simple empty `<div>` element.


**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NextJs\youbrief\server\tsconfig.json`**:  This file was modified three times between 7:08 PM and 7:35 PM. The key change was setting `"outDir": "./dist"` and changing `"module": "commonjs"` to `"module": "module"` and back to  `"module": "commonjs"`.  Other modifications involved uncommenting `"rootDir": "./src"` which specifies the root directory for source files.  Numerous compiler options were commented and uncommented, indicating experimentation with different build settings.  It ultimately settled on `commonjs` as the module system.

**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NextJs\youbrief\server\package.json`**: This file was modified multiple times between 7:11 PM and 7:11 PM.  The "build" script changed from `tsc -` to `tsc -b`, enabling the use of tsconfig.json's build options. The start command was adjusted to point to the `dist` folder after compilation. The `dev` script was temporarily removed and then set to `npm run build && npm run start`, implying a shift to a build-then-run development workflow.

**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NextJs\youbrief\server\src\index.ts`**:  Changes in this file (7:12 PM to 7:32 PM) focused on setting up the Express.js server. It started with basic imports, then added JSON and URL-encoded body parsing, and finally, implemented CORS with `origin: '*'`.  A basic route (`/`) was added that sends a message confirming that the API is running.  The server listening port was set to 3000 using environment variables. Importantly, the server's main route was wired to the `briefRoute` at the end.


**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NextJs\youbrief\server\src\controllers\breifControllers.ts`**: This file contains the core logic of the server, significantly evolving from 7:13 PM to 7:20 PM. Initially, it was a basic controller to fetch data; however,  it was then significantly altered to include:
*   Import statements for `youtube-transcript` and `@google/generative-ai`.
*   Fetching YouTube transcripts using `videoId` from the request parameters.
*   Constructing a prompt to summarize the captions using Google's Gemini API.
*   Generating a summary using the Gemini API and returning it to the client.


**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\NextJs\youbrief\server\src\routes\briefRoute.ts`**:  This file, created around 7:30 PM, defines a route `/api/v1/breif` that uses the `getBreif` controller.  The route was initially `GET`, then changed to `POST` before settling on a `POST` at the endpoint `/breif`.


Overall, the log reflects the iterative development of an API that fetches YouTube transcripts, uses Google's Gemini API to generate summaries, and serves them via a RESTful endpoint. The significant changes clustered around 7:15 PM to 7:20 PM represent the core implementation of the summary generation functionality. The final structure of the server involved the use of environment variables for API keys and port number.  A `.gitignore` was added, demonstrating good practice in version control by excluding `.env`, `node_modules`, and the build output directory.
