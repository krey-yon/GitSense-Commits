# Activity Summary for 1/9/2025

## 8:57:12 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Prsnl\www\src\lib\constants.ts` between 8:08 PM and 8:10 PM on January 9th, 2025.  The file contains data for navigation items (`navItems`) and featured projects (`topProjects`).  `navItems` remained unchanged throughout the log, always containing a single entry for "Projects".

The `topProjects` array is the focus of the changes.  Initially, it contained two identical entries for a project titled 'CTM'.  Subsequent edits involved:

1. **8:09 PM:** One 'CTM' entry was renamed to 'NoBg',  while retaining other data (apart from the title).

2. **8:10 PM - 8:10:24 PM:** Several minor changes were made to the 'NoBg' project entry. The timeline was updated from 'Dec 2024' to 'Jan 2024', and the tagline was changed to accurately reflect its function ("A website to remove background from images.").

3. **8:10:41 PM:** The source code and live demo links for 'NoBg' were corrected to point to the correct repository (`https://github.com/krey-yon/NoBG`) and deployment (`https://nobg.kreyon.tech/`).

The final state of `topProjects` shows two distinct projects: 'CTM' and 'NoBg', each with its own accurate details.  There were multiple redundant commits between 8:10:06 PM and 8:10:16 PM that seem to be an artifact of the commit process.  The most significant changes were made between 8:09 PM and 8:10:41 PM, specifically updating the 'NoBg' project's information and correcting its associated links.
