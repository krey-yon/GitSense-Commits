# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 5:46:40 AM
The log shows the development of a `post` module using Prisma and Next.js.  The primary focus is on creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.

The `src/lib/post.ts` file underwent extensive modification between 4:46 AM and 5:13 AM on April 12, 2025.  Initially, the `createPost` function was rudimentary, evolving to incorporate Prisma's `post.create` method.  The function's parameters and data handling were refined, including adding a `caption` parameter and handling the `imageURL` (initially with a default value and later removing the explicit default).  Around 5:10 AM, `readPost`, `updatePost`, and `deletePost` functions were added, gradually completing the CRUD operations.  These functions leverage Prisma's `findMany`, `update`, and `delete` methods, respectively.  The `updatePost` function uses the `postId` for targeted updates.

The `prisma/schema.prisma` file was updated between 5:06 AM and 5:07 AM on April 12, 2025.  The changes involved setting a default value for the `imageURL` field in the `post` model.  The default was changed from `"http:local"` to `"http://localhost:3000/randomimage.jpg"` to provide a more realistic default image URL.  The correction of `http:local` to `http://localhost:3000/randomimage.jpg` suggests a minor error correction.


The overall pattern reveals iterative development, with frequent small commits reflecting a build-up of functionality. The code consistently uses Prisma ORM for database interactions.
