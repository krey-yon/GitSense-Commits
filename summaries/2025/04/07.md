# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 11:15:02 AM
The log shows multiple edits to the `tsconfig.json` file within the `Eatopia` project's `http-be` app.  The file specifies TypeScript compiler options, primarily extending a base configuration from `@repo/typescript-config/base.json`.  The `rootDir` and `outDir` are consistently set to `"./src"` and `"./dist"` respectively.

The most significant change occurred around 10:33 AM on April 7th, 2025.  During this period, the `extends` property briefly lost the `base.json` suffix, resulting in a likely temporary compiler error before being corrected.  Otherwise, the file contents remained largely stable throughout the logged edits.  The repeated identical edits suggest potential automated processes or version control system conflicts causing minor, quickly resolved changes.
