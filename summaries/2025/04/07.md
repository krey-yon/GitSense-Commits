# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 11:15:02 AM
The log shows multiple edits to the `tsconfig.json` file within the `Eatopia` project's `http-be` app.  The file specifies TypeScript compiler options, primarily extending a base configuration from `@repo/typescript-config/base.json`.  The `rootDir` and `outDir` are consistently set to `"./src"` and `"./dist"` respectively.

The most significant change occurred around 10:33 AM on April 7th, 2025.  During this period, the `extends` property briefly lost the `base.json` suffix, resulting in a likely temporary compiler error before being corrected.  Otherwise, the file contents remained largely stable throughout the logged edits.  The repeated identical edits suggest potential automated processes or version control system conflicts causing minor, quickly resolved changes.


## 3:15:01 PM
The log shows multiple edits to the `tsconfig.json` file within the `eatopia\apps\http-be` directory between 2:48 PM and 2:50 PM on April 7th, 2025.  These edits focused on modifying the `"extends"` property, experimenting with different paths to a base TypeScript configuration file.  The initial attempts used relative paths (`../../tsconfig.base.json`, `../../typescript/base.json`),  later shifting to  `@repo`-prefixed paths,  eventually settling on `"@repo/typescript-config/base.json"`.  The `compilerOptions` remained consistent throughout, setting `rootDir` to `"./src"` and `outDir` to `"./dist"`.

A single change to `src\index.ts` at 3:08 PM on the same day introduces a basic Express.js server that listens on port 3000 (or a port specified by the `PORT` environment variable) and responds with "Hello World!".


## 4:15:02 PM
The log shows iterative changes to the `package.json` file within the `Eatopia\eatopia\apps\http-be` directory.  The file defines a Node.js project named "http-be".

Between 3:18:24 PM and 3:19:10 PM on April 7th, 2025, the `scripts` section of the `package.json` underwent several modifications.  Initially, it was empty.  Subsequent updates added and refined build and development scripts.  Specifically:

* A "bi" script was added (purpose unclear, likely incomplete).
* A "build" script using `tsc -b` (likely TypeScript compilation) was added.
* A "dev" script was added, combining compilation with running the application using `node dist/index.js`.
* Finally, a "start" script to run the application directly was included.

The dependencies, consisting of `@types/express` and `express`, remained consistent throughout the updates.  The overall pattern suggests a process of setting up build and execution commands for the project.


## 9:23:19 PM
The log shows two entries modifying the `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\eatopia\.env` file.  Both entries contain a PostgreSQL database connection string, differing only in formatting. The first entry uses a single `=` before the connection string, while the second uses `DATABASE_URL=` to label the connection string.  The changes occurred within a short timeframe, between 8:26:31 PM and 8:26:43 PM on April 7th, 2025.  The likely pattern is a correction in the file to properly name the database URL environment variable.
