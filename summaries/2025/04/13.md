# Activity Summary for 4/13/2025

## 12:04:18 AM
The log shows development on a restaurant dashboard feature within the Eatopia application.  The primary focus is on the `action.ts` file, which handles the creation and retrieval of restaurant data.

Between 11:07 PM and 11:17 PM on April 12th, 2025, `action.ts` underwent significant changes.  Initially, the `CreateRestaurant` function was rudimentary.  The code progressively evolved to include database interaction using Prisma (`prisma.restaurant.create`), incorporating user authentication via `getCurrentSession` to connect the created restaurant to the current user, and handling potential errors with a `try...catch` block.  The final version of `CreateRestaurant` successfully creates a restaurant record, associating it with a logged-in user and returning success or failure messages.

Around 11:57 PM on April 12th, a new function, `getRestaurant`, was added to `action.ts`. This function retrieves restaurant information from the database based on a provided `userId`.  Further refinements were made to this function to handle errors appropriately and return the retrieved restaurant data.

Concurrently, the `useRestaurantForm.ts` file was modified between 11:23 PM and 11:26 PM on April 12th, 2025. This hook was adjusted to utilize the `CreateRestaurant` action from `action.ts` within a `useZodForm` context, likely for form validation and submission handling within the restaurant creation form.

Finally, the `page.tsx` file (April 12th and 13th) went through several iterations.  Initially, it was a simple component.  Later, authentication was added, redirecting non-restaurant users.  The most significant change came between 12:00 AM and 12:04 AM on April 13th, 2025, where it integrated the `getRestaurant` function from `action.ts`.  Based on the presence or absence of a restaurant for the user, it conditionally renders a `CreateRestaurant` component from `create-restaurant.tsx`, added at approximately 12:02 AM. This component is likely a form allowing users to create a new restaurant entry. The redirection logic guides users appropriately depending on whether a restaurant already exists for the logged in user.
