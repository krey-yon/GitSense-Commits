# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 10:45:50 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `c:\Users\user\Desktop\fullstacks project\Eatopia\src\components\create-menu-modal.tsx`  between 10:09 AM and 10:10 AM on April 15, 2025.  The file is a React component representing a modal for creating restaurant menus.

The primary changes revolve around the `useState` hook and the initial state of the `open` variable within the `CreateMenuModal` component.  Initially, the `open` state was missing (or implicitly `false`), resulting in a closed modal.  Between 10:09:34 AM and 10:09:39 AM, `useState(true)` was added, making the modal open by default. This was then removed again at 10:10:22 AM, reverting the modal to a initially closed state.  No other significant changes to the component's functionality or structure were made during this period.  The component consistently uses UI components from `@/components/ui`, and interacts with a `createMenu` function from `@/app/dashboard/restaurant/action` via a custom hook `useMutationData`.
