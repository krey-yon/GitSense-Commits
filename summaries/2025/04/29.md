# Activity Summary for 4/29/2025

## 3:44:12 PM
The log shows modifications to deployment scripts and a GitHub workflow file between 3:05 PM and 3:43 PM on April 29, 2025.

The `deploy.sh` file underwent several revisions.  Initially (3:05 PM), it contained commands to pull from a git repository, install dependencies, build, and start the application. Later revisions (3:37 PM, 3:38 PM, and 3:43 PM) refined this process, ultimately adding `pm2 start` for process management and changing the working directory to `/root/backend_projects/t3arena_be` in the final version.  There was a noticeable change to the starting command from `npm run start` to `pm2 start npm --start` which might indicate a transition to a process manager.

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file was extensively modified between 3:07 PM and 3:10 PM. This involved incrementally building a GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.  The workflow's name was set to "deploy to vm," triggered on pushes to the `main` branch.  The core functionality, defining a job to checkout the code using `actions/checkout@v2`,  was added gradually, indicating a step-by-step development process.  The initial stages only contained the name and on push section of the workflow, with later additions to include the job section that specifies the runtime and checkout steps.
