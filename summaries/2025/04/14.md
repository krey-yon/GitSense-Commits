# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 8:25:36 AM
The log shows development of Eatopia, a restaurant management application.  Initial changes (7:44 AM) focused on establishing mock backend functionality for menus and orders using TypeScript. `menu.ts` defines types and mock functions for managing menu items and menus, simulating API delays. `order.ts` similarly mocks Redis pub/sub for order management, subscribing to and processing mock order events.

Between 7:44 AM and 7:50 AM, a `create-menu-modal.tsx` component was created and slightly modified. This component is a modal for creating new restaurant menus, preventing accidental closure until the menu is created.

At 7:56 AM, a `Restaurant` component was added to fetch and display restaurant information.  Simultaneously, a `DashboardSidebar` component was created and then heavily modified (7:56 AM - 7:57 AM) to improve navigation within the dashboard. Specifically, several updates altered the routing within the sidebar, changing the route to `/dashboard/restaurant/[restaurantId]` for the menu section.

A `MenuItemForm` component (7:58 AM) was introduced, providing a form to add new menu items, handling form submission and data updates.  A corresponding `MenuItemsList` component (7:59 AM) displays the list of menu items, fetching data and formatting prices.

An `OrdersDisplay` component (7:59 AM - 8:00 AM) displays real-time order updates, subscribing to order events and providing functionality to mark orders as ready. A minor change updated the badge variant.

The `DashboardLayout` component (8:07 AM) is introduced, containing the `DashboardSidebar` and main content area.  Finally, a `MenuPage` component (8:13 AM - 8:16 AM) was added to manage the menu.  This page underwent several revisions, correcting the `menuId` prop passed to child components, ultimately setting it to an empty string. There was an attempt to add a `key` prop to `MenuItemForm`, but the value is left as an empty object literal `key={}`, indicating an incomplete implementation.


## 9:25:36 AM
The log shows development of a restaurant dashboard within the Eatopia application.  Early changes focused on the structure of the menu management pages (`page.tsx` files), progressively adding features like a `MenuItemForm`, `MenuItemsList`, `CreateMenuModal`, and handling loading states with `Suspense`.  The `menuId` prop was added to these components around 8:44 AM.  A significant refactor occurred around 8:45 AM, splitting the menu page into `page.tsx` and `(menu-inside)\page.tsx` to fetch menu data and conditionally render a creation modal if the menu doesn't exist. The `getRestaurantMenu` function was introduced.

Between 8:30 AM and 8:51 AM, the `layout.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions, primarily changing the mocked `restaurantId` returned by `getRestaurantId()`.  The mock ID evolved from a simple string ("restaurant-123") to a more complex UUID ("419d45f1-b271-495b-8418-d66c78a91c68"), and finally included  "/menu" or was modified to include  "/menu" as a suffix. This suggests experimentation with routing and ID handling.

At 8:58 AM, the `dashboard-sidebar.tsx` component was created, providing navigation links for the restaurant dashboard, dynamically using the `restaurantId` prop.

The final significant changes (from 9:08 AM to 9:12 AM) involved the `page.tsx` file for the restaurant dashboard itself.  Initially, the code attempted to redirect users based on their role and fetch restaurant data, but this was eventually commented out.  The file was refactored to display an `OrdersDisplay` component.  The commented-out code suggests an initial approach to authentication and conditional rendering based on user role and the existence of a restaurant. The final version retrieves user data, fetches the restaurant, and renders a restaurant creation component or redirects the user accordingly.  The `getRestaurantId` function was added and integrated with the session data. The `findRestaurant` variable was not declared, likely causing an error.
