# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 8:25:36 AM
The log shows development of Eatopia, a restaurant management application.  Initial changes (7:44 AM) focused on establishing mock backend functionality for menus and orders using TypeScript. `menu.ts` defines types and mock functions for managing menu items and menus, simulating API delays. `order.ts` similarly mocks Redis pub/sub for order management, subscribing to and processing mock order events.

Between 7:44 AM and 7:50 AM, a `create-menu-modal.tsx` component was created and slightly modified. This component is a modal for creating new restaurant menus, preventing accidental closure until the menu is created.

At 7:56 AM, a `Restaurant` component was added to fetch and display restaurant information.  Simultaneously, a `DashboardSidebar` component was created and then heavily modified (7:56 AM - 7:57 AM) to improve navigation within the dashboard. Specifically, several updates altered the routing within the sidebar, changing the route to `/dashboard/restaurant/[restaurantId]` for the menu section.

A `MenuItemForm` component (7:58 AM) was introduced, providing a form to add new menu items, handling form submission and data updates.  A corresponding `MenuItemsList` component (7:59 AM) displays the list of menu items, fetching data and formatting prices.

An `OrdersDisplay` component (7:59 AM - 8:00 AM) displays real-time order updates, subscribing to order events and providing functionality to mark orders as ready. A minor change updated the badge variant.

The `DashboardLayout` component (8:07 AM) is introduced, containing the `DashboardSidebar` and main content area.  Finally, a `MenuPage` component (8:13 AM - 8:16 AM) was added to manage the menu.  This page underwent several revisions, correcting the `menuId` prop passed to child components, ultimately setting it to an empty string. There was an attempt to add a `key` prop to `MenuItemForm`, but the value is left as an empty object literal `key={}`, indicating an incomplete implementation.
