# Activity Summary for 4/9/2025

## 9:04:15 AM
The log shows updates to the `lucia-auth\.env` file between 8:13 AM and 8:17 AM on April 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve populating environment variables.  Initially, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` were empty.  At 8:13:19 AM, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` received a value.  A minute later, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` was filled in. Finally, at 8:17:41 AM, a `DATABASE_URL` variable was added, specifying a PostgreSQL connection string.  The pattern is a gradual filling of environment variables required for the application's operation.
