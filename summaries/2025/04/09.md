# Activity Summary for 4/9/2025

## 9:04:15 AM
The log shows updates to the `lucia-auth\.env` file between 8:13 AM and 8:17 AM on April 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve populating environment variables.  Initially, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` were empty.  At 8:13:19 AM, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` received a value.  A minute later, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` was filled in. Finally, at 8:17:41 AM, a `DATABASE_URL` variable was added, specifying a PostgreSQL connection string.  The pattern is a gradual filling of environment variables required for the application's operation.


## 10:04:17 AM
The log shows development of a GitHub OAuth login system.  The `prisma/schema.prisma` file underwent several revisions between 9:37 AM and 9:42 AM,  evolving the `User` model. Initially, it included `name`, `email`, and `password` fields. These were subsequently replaced with  `githubId` and then  `githubId` and `username`, reflecting a shift towards GitHub-based authentication.

Around 9:48 AM, the `src/app/lib/oauth.ts` file was modified multiple times with minor changes to the type assertion for environment variables within the GitHub OAuth client initialization.  This suggests debugging or refining the environment variable handling.

A significant change occurred at 9:50 AM when the `src/app/login/github/route.ts` file was created, implementing the initial GitHub OAuth authorization flow, including state management using cookies.  Simultaneously, the `.env` file was updated to include `NODE_ENV="development"`, confirming the development context.

The `src/app/login/github/callback/route.ts` file, created around 9:52 AM, handles the OAuth callback, validating the authorization code, fetching GitHub user details, and creating or retrieving user sessions from the database. This highlights the core authentication logic.

Finally,  between 9:56 AM and 10:04 AM the `src/lib/session.ts` file was extensively modified to implement session management.  The changes involved adding error handling, refining the session token generation with the `@oslojs/encoding` library and integrating session creation with Prisma.  Importantly,  at 10:04 AM,  the session creation was updated to use Prisma's ORM instead of direct SQL, indicating a move to a more structured database interaction.  This file's multiple edits showcase iterative development of the session handling from a basic token generation to database persistence using Prisma.  The final inclusion of the `prisma` object from `./db.js` at 10:03 AM completed the integration of the database interaction into the session handling logic.


## 9:27:46 PM
The primary change involves the `prisma/schema.prisma` file at 8:58:53 PM on 4/9/2025. This schema defines a data model for an application (likely a food delivery platform),  including entities like `User`, `Restaurant`, `Menu`, `MenuItems`, and `Order`.  The model uses UUIDs for primary keys and establishes relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many relationships between restaurants and menus, users and orders).  The database provider is specified as PostgreSQL, with the connection string sourced from an environment variable.

Subsequent changes were made to the `.env` file, updating the `DATABASE_URL` variable.  Initially (9:01:04 PM and 9:02:22 PM), it pointed to a local PostgreSQL instance.  This was later altered (9:04:05 PM) to connect to a Neon database hosted on AWS.


Finally, a `.gitignore` file was updated at 9:04:37 PM, adding (or updating) rules to ignore various files and directories, including `.env` files, build artifacts, and debug logs.  This suggests a deliberate effort to manage the project's version control and exclude sensitive data from the repository.
