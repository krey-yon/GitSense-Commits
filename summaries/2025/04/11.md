# Activity Summary for 4/11/2025

## 1:18:15 AM
The log shows development activity across several files.  `layout.tsx` underwent several minor, seemingly inconsequential edits between 12:26:04 AM and 12:26:31 AM, mostly involving insignificant changes in the body tag of the HTML.

The `prisma/schema.prisma` file shows a more substantial evolution of the database schema between 12:26:49 AM and 12:30:55 AM.  The `post` model was initially defined with just an `author` field (which later changed to `author String`). The schema was then iteratively refined, adding an `id` field (with auto-increment), `createdAt` timestamp (with default `now()`), a `caption` field (String), and finally an `imageUrl` field with a default placeholder image URL. This reflects a step-by-step process of designing and implementing the database structure.

The `.env` file shows a repeated pattern of modifying the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with multiple connection strings, experimenting with different database configurations, users, passwords, and hostnames (including a reference to `my-postgres`, suggesting a containerized database).  This suggests the developer is setting up a PostgreSQL database connection. These changes happened between 12:32:37 AM and 1:02:13 AM, with several additional attempts at 12:38:15 AM, 12:46:12 AM, 12:46:58 AM, 12:49:46 AM, 12:53:12 AM, 12:54:45 AM, 12:55:10 AM.

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains a few minor edits between 12:37:08 AM and 12:37:34 AM related to the formatting and spacing of the environment variables within the `db` service definition, indicating minor adjustments to the docker configuration.


Finally, the `src/app/page.tsx` file had minor adjustments to its className around 1:06 AM, and the `src/lib/db.ts` and `src/lib/post.ts` files show the creation and refinement of database interaction functions.  The `src/lib/post.ts` file, between 1:10:20 AM and 1:18:07 AM, shows the development of functions `createPost` (for creating a post in the database), and `readPost` (likely for fetching posts).  The `createPost` function was progressively built, adding error handling and the actual implementation of creating a database entry.  The `readPost` function remains incomplete.
