# Activity Summary for 4/28/2025

## 9:45:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `page.tsx` and `restaurant.tsx`.  The `page.tsx` file, between 8:56 PM and 8:57 PM, underwent several minor changes, primarily involving the `Restaurant` component's prop. Initially,  `restaurantId` was passed, then it was briefly changed to `restaurant`,  then back to `restaurantId`, and finally it was removed entirely before being readded. These alterations suggest experimentation with how the `Restaurant` component receives its data.

The `restaurant.tsx` file, modified between 9:00 PM and 9:07 PM, shows a more significant change.  The initial version correctly received `restaurant` data as props.  Subsequent edits incorrectly attempted to use  `restaurantI` and `restaurantId` as string props. The correct prop type `{restaurantId: string}` was eventually restored after several attempts. This series of changes likely reflects debugging efforts to correctly pass the restaurant ID to the component.  The component itself renders a restaurant card with an image, name, cuisine, rating, and delivery time, using UI components from the `@/components/ui` directory and Lucide-React icons.  The repeated errors in the prop declaration highlight a potential misunderstanding of TypeScript interface types or prop drilling within the application.
