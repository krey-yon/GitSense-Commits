# Activity Summary for 4/4/2025

## 12:14:16 AM
The log shows development of a real-time chat application using Redis Pub/Sub and WebSockets.  The main development happened between 11:24 PM and 12:13 AM on April 4th, 2025.

**`index.ts` (Server-side logic):**  Initially, the file set up a basic server using Express, HTTP, and WebSockets, connecting to a local Redis instance.  Significant changes involved correctly importing the `WebSocketServer` from the `ws` package (multiple attempts visible).  Around 11:42 PM, middleware was added (`express.json()`) and static file serving (`express.static`).  An endpoint for serving the `index.html` was created.  Finally, a Redis subscriber was added (with several attempts to correctly instantiate it using `redisClient.duplicate()`), and the WebSocket connection was integrated to publish messages received from clients to the "chat" Redis channel.  The server is configured to listen on port 3000.

**`index.html` (Client-side logic):** This file underwent numerous iterations. Early versions contained minimal or no content.  Between 11:40 PM and 12:13 AM, it evolved into a fully functional chat interface including HTML elements for displaying messages, typing messages, and sending them. The JavaScript added establishes a WebSocket connection to the server and includes a function to send messages.  Around 12:12 AM,  a `fetch` call was added to periodically retrieve messages from a `/get-chat-data` endpoint, suggesting the addition of a separate worker to handle message retrieval from Redis.

**`worker/index.ts` (Worker):** This file was created later in the process, around 11:53 PM. It sets up another Express server that handles a `/get-chat-data` endpoint. This endpoint subscribes to the "chat" channel in Redis and returns the received messages in JSON format.


The overall pattern shows iterative development with several corrections in the WebSocket and Redis client setup.  The final version demonstrates a basic but functional chat application, which receives, publishes and retrieves messages from Redis. The process includes both client and server-side improvements over time.
