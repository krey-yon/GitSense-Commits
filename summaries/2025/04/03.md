# Activity Summary for 4/3/2025

## 11:14:14 PM
The log shows development of a Node.js application using Express.js, Redis, and WebSockets.

Initially, two `package.json` files were created (one for the main application and one for a worker), both specifying TypeScript as a peer dependency and using Bun as the runtime.  Minor, inconsequential edits to the main application's `package.json` occurred within a short time frame (10:15 PM).

The main application's `index.ts` file underwent significant changes between 11:00 PM and 11:01 PM.  It started as a simple Express.js server that used Redis to store code submissions.  The server then evolved to incorporate a WebSocket server (`ws` package) and the Redis client was configured with a URL connection string (`redis://localhost:6379`).  A small typo ("ws.Server" changed to "ws.server") is also present in one of the commits.  The final version suggests a real-time application architecture using WebSockets to potentially push updates from Redis to connected clients.
