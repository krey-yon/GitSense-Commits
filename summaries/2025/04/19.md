# Activity Summary for 4/19/2025

## 8:51:51 AM
The log shows development activity on the Eatopia project, focusing on the Prisma schema and restaurant creation functionality.

**prisma/schema.prisma:**  Multiple revisions occurred between 7:55 AM and 7:56 AM, adding a `cuisine` field to the `Restaurant` model.  A `rating` field of type `Float` was added at 7:56:07 AM. Subsequent changes between 7:56 AM and 8:18 AM appear to be corrections or reversions, removing the `rating` field and leaving only the `cuisine` field addition.  This file defines the database schema using Prisma.

**src/app/dashboard/restaurant/action.ts:**  Changes between 8:25 AM and 8:30 AM reflect the addition of `imageUrl` and `cuisine` fields to the `CreateRestaurant` function, to match the schema updates. The file contains functions for creating and managing restaurants, menus, and menu items using Prisma Client.  These functions handle database interactions, including error handling and Next.js cache invalidation (`revalidatePath`).

**src/lib/definitions.ts:**  Between 8:26 AM and 8:29 AM, multiple revisions focused on refining the `RestaurantFormSchema` in the `zod` schema. Specifically, the `cuisine` field was added and improved validation was added to ensure it's at least one word long. An `imageUrl` field was also added to this schema at 8:28:43 AM. These schema definitions validate user inputs for forms in the application, including sign-up, sign-in, restaurant creation, and menu item creation.  The revisions add robust validation to the `cuisine` field and adds an `imageUrl` field to `RestaurantFormSchema`.

**src/components/create-restaurant.tsx:**  The changes made between 8:31 AM and 8:50 AM show the addition of input fields for `cuisine` and `image_url` to the restaurant creation form, and some minor styling changes. Initially, there were duplicated address fields; these were corrected.  The `onSubmit` handler of the form changed from `onFormSubmit` to `handleSubmit` at 8:50:45 AM.  The component renders a form for creating restaurants and uses custom components (`FormGenerator`, `Card`, `Button`).  The form uses the `useRestaurantForm` hook for form state management and validation.

In summary, the code changes track the iterative development of a restaurant creation feature within the Eatopia application, involving schema definition, data manipulation, and user interface updates, with a focus on enhancing data validation and ensuring consistency between the backend and frontend.  The most significant changes were made within a short period of time in the morning of 4/19/2025.
