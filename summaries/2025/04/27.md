# Activity Summary for 4/27/2025

## 12:57:58 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `c:\Users\user\Desktop\temp\Neutro\backend\.env` file between 12:34 PM and 12:45 PM on April 27, 2025.  These updates primarily involve modifications to the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.  Initially, the `MONGODB_URI` points to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. Subsequently,  the connection string is changed several times: first to a local MongoDB instance (`mongodb://admin:secret@localhost:27017`), then to `mongodb://localhost:27017/neutro` (specifying the database name), and finally to a different MongoDB Atlas cluster (`mongodb+srv://neutro-user:pass123@vikasdb.smceh.mongodb.net/`). The other environment variables (`PORT`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY`) remain unchanged throughout the log.  The directory structure of the backend application remains consistent across all entries, indicating that only the `.env` file was modified during this period.
