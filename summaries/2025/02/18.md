# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 7:49:50 PM
The README.md file was updated on February 18, 2025, at 6:54:54 PM.  The update includes a standard Next.js project description, setup instructions (using npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun), and information on how to start editing the application.  It also mentions the use of `next/font` for font optimization and lists project contributors. Finally, it includes sample JSON data within a collapsible section, presumably for an API route within the `letter-gen` application.  The JSON data represents a candidate profile, including age, skills, experience, education, and target role/company.
