# Activity Summary for 2/10/2025

## 10:19:15 PM
The primary changes revolve around the `route.ts` file, which imports necessary modules for image uploading.  Initially, the imports were incomplete or incorrect, with several edits between 9:47 PM and 9:47:36 PM to finalize the `auth` import from `@clerk/nextjs/server`. At 10:12:07 PM, Cloudinary configuration was added, referencing environment variables for cloud name, API key, and API secret.


The `.env.local` file underwent multiple updates between 10:12:26 PM and 10:14:29 PM.  These changes involved progressively populating the `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`  environment variables, indicating the setup and configuration of Cloudinary's credentials.  The `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`  variable remained empty until the final commit of the `.env.local` file which has all the required credentials filled.  The other variables in `.env.local` (related to Clerk) remained unchanged throughout the log.
