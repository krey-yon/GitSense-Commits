# Activity Summary for 2/11/2025

## 10:58:48 AM
The log shows development of two features: social media image sharing and video uploading.

The `social-share` component (`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\cloudinary-saas\src\app\(app)\social-share\page.tsx`) underwent significant changes between 10:27 AM and 10:40 AM.  Initially, it was a simple component rendering "socialShare".  The major updates involved:

* **10:28:02 AM:**  Import of `CldImage` from `next-cloudinary`, suggesting integration with Cloudinary for image manipulation.
* **10:28:45 AM - 10:31:05 AM:**  Progressive definition of the `socialFormats` constant, adding specifications for different social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook) including width, height, and aspect ratios.
* **10:31:59 AM:** Definition of `SocialFormat` type, improving type safety.
* **10:33:21 AM - 10:39:30 AM:**  Addition of state management using `useState` for `uploadedImage`, `selectedFormat`, `isUploading`, and `isTransforming`.  An `useEffect` hook is introduced to manage the `isTransforming` state based on `uploadedImage`. The `handleFileUpload` function is implemented, handling image uploads via a `/api/image-upload` endpoint.  The `handleDownload` function is added to download the processed image.  Finally, a UI is built using a framework like Tailwind CSS, enabling image uploading, format selection, preview, and download.  The code was refined for better readability and error handling during this phase.  Note that the `aspectRatio` property in `socialFormats` was initially misspelled as `aspectRation` and corrected in later commits.


The `video-upload` component (`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\cloudinary-saas\src\app\(app)\video-upload\page.tsx`) was developed between 10:53 AM and 10:58 AM. This involved:

* **10:53:11 AM - 10:53:59 AM:** Initial setup of the component with state for file, title, description, and upload status.  A `MAX_FILE_SIZE` constant is introduced.
* **10:54:25 AM - 10:58:36 AM:** Implementation of `handleSubmit` function which handles form submission, file size validation, and makes a POST request to `/api/video-upload`.  After a successful upload (status code 200), it redirects to the root path (`/`).  A basic UI is then added to the component enabling video upload.


There is a clear pattern in both components:  both use asynchronous operations (using `fetch` and `axios`), state management for handling asynchronous operations (loading indicators), and UI built to interact with the user.  Both components also appear to integrate with a backend API for file uploading.  The social-share component uses Cloudinary for image transformation while the video upload component's backend API handling is not clearly specified.


## 11:58:45 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\cloudinary-saas\src\app\(app)\video-upload\page.tsx` on 2/11/2025 at 10:58:59 AM.  This file contains a React component (`VideoUpload`) for uploading videos.  The component handles form submission, file selection (with a 70MB size limit), and uses `axios` to send video data (including title and description) to an API endpoint (`/api/video-upload`).  Upon successful upload (indicated by a 200 response), it redirects the user to the root path (`/`). Error handling and visual feedback (using a loading state) are implemented. The code uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  A notable TODO is adding a notification for files exceeding the size limit.


## 12:58:45 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `middleware.ts` file between 12:08 PM and 12:10 PM on February 11, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent:  authentication middleware using Clerk.js to protect routes and APIs.

The primary change revolves around the `isPublicApi` route matcher within the file.  Initially, `/api/videos` was the only public API endpoint. At 12:08:48 PM, `/api/image-upload` was added. This was then briefly removed at 12:09:43 PM before being restored at 12:09:57 PM.  The rest of the middleware logic (redirecting users based on authentication status and route access) remained unchanged throughout the revisions.  The `config` object, defining the matcher for the middleware, also remained constant across all revisions.
