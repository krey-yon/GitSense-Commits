# Activity Summary for 2/7/2025

## 1:26:36 PM
The log shows multiple edits to a `.env` file between 12:26 PM and 12:33 PM on February 7, 2025.  All changes involve modifications to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.  Initially, the database URL pointed to a local PostgreSQL instance (`localhost:5432/chaiDB`).  A minor edit at 12:30:40 PM added `?schema=public` to the URL.  The most significant change occurred at 12:33:07 PM, switching the database connection to a remote Neon PostgreSQL instance (`ep-wild-cell-a8ajwsoi-pooler.eastus2.azure.neon.tech/neondb`).  The username and password were also updated in this change.  The comments in the file consistently describe how Prisma utilizes environment variables.


## 10:05:01 PM
The log shows the iterative development of an API route (`route.ts`) to fetch videos from a PostgreSQL database using Prisma.  The initial changes (9:12 PM - 9:13 PM) focused on importing necessary modules (`NextRequest`, `NextResponse`, `PrismaClient`) and establishing a Prisma client instance. The route initially attempted to fetch and return videos (9:13:17 PM), then error handling was added (9:13:38 PM - 9:14:19 PM), evolving to include a `finally` block to disconnect from the database (9:14:32 PM). The response structure was refined (9:14:19 PM).  Around 9:18 PM,  `orderBy` was added to the `findMany` query to sort videos by creation date (`createdAt`). There were several minor edits between 9:18 PM and 9:21 PM, primarily concerning formatting and the use of `NextRequest` in the function signature, which was then removed at 9:27 PM. A temporary logging statement was added to the `catch` block at 9:27 PM and then removed at 9:28 PM.  At 9:31 PM, there is a very brief change where `prisma.Video` was used instead of `prisma.video`, then corrected back at 9:32 PM.  The `prisma/schema.prisma` file shows the database schema definition for the `Video` model, including fields like `id`, `title`, `description`, and size information, added at 9:32:36 PM. The final edits to `route.ts` (9:32:50 PM and 9:33:08 PM) show the developer interrupted before completing the query.  The overall pattern suggests a process of building a robust API endpoint for retrieving videos, implementing error handling, and ensuring database connection closure.
