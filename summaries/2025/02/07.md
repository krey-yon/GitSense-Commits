# Activity Summary for 2/7/2025

## 1:26:36 PM
The log shows multiple edits to a `.env` file between 12:26 PM and 12:33 PM on February 7, 2025.  All changes involve modifications to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.  Initially, the database URL pointed to a local PostgreSQL instance (`localhost:5432/chaiDB`).  A minor edit at 12:30:40 PM added `?schema=public` to the URL.  The most significant change occurred at 12:33:07 PM, switching the database connection to a remote Neon PostgreSQL instance (`ep-wild-cell-a8ajwsoi-pooler.eastus2.azure.neon.tech/neondb`).  The username and password were also updated in this change.  The comments in the file consistently describe how Prisma utilizes environment variables.
