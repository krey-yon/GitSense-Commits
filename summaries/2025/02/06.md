# Activity Summary for 2/6/2025

## 8:41:48 PM
The log shows edits to three React component files within a `cloudinary-saas` application.  The `home/page.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 7:45 PM and 7:46 PM on February 6th, 2025, primarily refining the component's name (from `page` to `Home`) and displayed text (from "page" to "Home Page").  The `social-share/page.tsx` file was similarly updated between 7:47 PM and 7:47 PM on the same day, correcting the component's name from `social-sh` to `SocialShare`, reflecting improved naming conventions.  Lastly, `video-upload/page.tsx` received minor edits at 7:48 PM and 7:49 PM on February 6th, 2025, with no changes in functionality but rather likely a save or minor formatting adjustments.  The key pattern is the iterative refinement of component names and displayed text in the React components, suggesting a development process focused on improving code clarity and user interface presentation.

The log shows modifications across several files.  The `.env` file and `.env.local` file track database connection details and Clerk API keys, respectively. The `prisma/schema.prisma` file defines the Prisma schema for a `Video` model, referencing the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.  The `pg_hba.conf` file was repeatedly modified, primarily changing the authentication method for PostgreSQL connections,  shifting from `scram-sha-256` and  `trust` to  `trust` only and finally settling on `scram-sha-256` for all local connections.

Specifically:

* **`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\cloudinary-saas\.env`**: This file underwent several changes to the `DATABASE_URL` variable throughout the log. Initially set to `postgresql://postgressDB:vikas123@localhost:5432/postgressDB`, it was later updated to `postgresql://postgressDB:admin@localhost:5432/postgressDB` and finally to `postgresql://admin:admin@localhost:5432/postgressDB`, indicating a change in the database user credentials.  These changes occurred between 10:16 PM and 11:14 PM.


* **`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\cloudinary-saas\.env.local`**: This file contains Clerk API keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`),  sign-in/sign-up URLs, and also includes the `DATABASE_URL`. This file was only modified once at 10:17:11 PM


* **`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\cloudinary-saas\prisma\schema.prisma`**:  This file, defining the database schema, remained unchanged in content after its initial modification at 10:21:50 PM.


* **`c:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\data\pg_hba.conf`**: This file saw multiple updates between 11:01:45 PM and 11:03:22 PM. The changes focused on modifying the authentication method (`METHOD`) in the configuration for PostgreSQL connections, fluctuating between `scram-sha-256` and `trust`. The final state uses `scram-sha-256` for all local connections. This suggests iterative adjustments to the database security settings.
