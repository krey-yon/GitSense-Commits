# Activity Summary for 2/12/2025

## 4:04:40 PM
The log shows development activity on a Next.js application named "Katen-Chart".  Significant changes occurred between 3:18 PM and 4:00 PM on February 12th, 2025.

**auth.ts:** This file was initially set up for Google authentication with NextAuth.js. A crucial update at 3:19:04 PM added a `secret` using an environment variable (`process.env.AUTH_SECRET`), indicating the introduction of authentication security.

**app/globals.css:** This file underwent multiple revisions between 3:25 PM and 3:26 PM, primarily focused on refining CSS animations and styling using Tailwind CSS.  The changes involved adjustments to transition durations and the addition of `clip-path` animations for light and dark mode transitions. No major functional changes to the CSS styles occurred. The final version at 3:26:36 PM seems to be the stable one.

**components/Header/Header.tsx:** This component, the application header, saw several edits.  Initially at 3:33:24 PM, it displayed a header with authentication buttons, a GitHub star button, and a theme toggle. A notable change at 3:34:08 PM modified the `TextLoop` to include a Japanese translation ("リーベ"). Further changes between 3:49 PM and 4:00 PM removed the "chart" text from the header title and updated the GitHubStarButton's repoUrl from  "https://github.com/senbo1/katen-chart" to "https://github.com/krey-yon", suggesting a potential repository change. At 4:00:42 PM, the commented-out `<XReviewsButton />` element was also removed.

**README.md:** The README file was updated multiple times, primarily to correct the repository URL from "https://github.com/senbo1/katen-chart" to "https://github.com/krey-yon/liebe". This indicates a change in the project's hosting location on GitHub.  A final update at 3:59:33 PM appears to contain the correct and final URL.

In summary, the development log shows iterative improvements and refinements in the UI (header and animations), the addition of authentication security, and a crucial update of the project's GitHub repository URL, moving from a personal to an organizational one. The project seems to be a seasonal anime tracking application.
