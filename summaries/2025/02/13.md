# Activity Summary for 2/13/2025

## 7:28:44 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `README.md` file for a Next.js project named `LetterGen` between 6:40 PM and 6:46 PM on February 13, 2025.  Initial commits were minor formatting adjustments to the title.  A substantial update at 6:41 PM added a complete README including sections on getting started, learning more about Next.js, deployment on Vercel, and contributors.  Later edits, starting around 6:42 PM, involved adding dummy data for a letter-generation API route.  This dummy data, a JSON object representing a candidate's profile, was initially added as plain text, then formatted within a code block and finally enclosed within a collapsible `<details>` element for better readability at 6:46 PM.  The final version of the README provides a comprehensive guide to the project.
