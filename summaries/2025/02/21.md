# Activity Summary for 2/21/2025

## 12:43:28 AM
The log shows development of a cover letter generator application.  The key changes are focused on the `src\app\result\page.tsx` and `src\components\dashboard-page.tsx` files, with several iterations related to fetching and displaying the cover letter.

**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\letter-gen\src\components\dashboard-page.tsx`**: This component, a multi-step form, remained largely unchanged structurally throughout the log. The most significant change was the removal of a `fetchCoverLetter` function and associated `useEffect` hook  around 12:30 AM. This function was initially included to fetch the cover letter, likely a premature optimization.  The commented-out code shows an initial attempt to manage form data state within the component before switching to a context-based approach.


**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\letter-gen\src\context\formcontext.tsx`**: This file shows the evolution of the context API for managing form data.  Initially, there was a syntax error in the `experience` array initialization in the `useState` call that was corrected between 11:49:01 PM and 11:49:39 PM.  The context now also includes the generated `coverLetter` and functions to update it.


**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\letter-gen\src\app\result\page.tsx`**: This file displays the generated cover letter. The major changes center around handling the display and generation of the letter.  Multiple edits between 11:53:20 PM and 12:37:25 AM involved correcting the `fetchCoverLetter` function's `body` parameter to correctly send the `formData` as JSON (using `JSON.stringify()`). There were also several minor UI changes, including the addition of `cursor-pointer` class to the header. The most substantial functional changes were the introduction of `isSubmitted` state and a `handleSubmit` function to control when the letter is fetched. A submit button was added near 12:26 AM and then later removed and replaced by text on the already-present submit button. Finally, the `useEffect` hook related to `fetchCoverLetter`  was refined to depend on `formData` and `isSubmitted` ensuring that the cover letter is fetched only after form submission.


**`c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStack\letter-gen\src\app\api\letter-gen\route.ts`**: This API route uses the Google Generative AI API to generate cover letters. The most important change was in identifying the API Key. The initial code used `process.env.GOOGLE_GEMINI_API`, but this was corrected to `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` near 12:09:49 AM, likely after a renaming or correction in the environment variables.  Also several changes were made to the prompt instructions to better guide the AI, aiming for a better generated cover letter and character limits.

In summary, the development process involved iterative refinements to the API call, UI improvements, and efficient state management using context API, resulting in a functional cover letter generator application.
