# Activity Summary for 2/28/2025

## 11:33:33 AM
The log shows development activity on a memeverse project, encompassing both backend and frontend components.  The backend (`memeverse\Backend`) development involved several iterations of the `package.json` file. Initially, the `type` field was added (indicating a shift to ES modules), followed by updates to the `author` and `description` fields.  Crucially, dependencies (axios, cors, dotenv, express) and devDependencies (@types/cors, @types/express, nodemon, typescript) were added around 10:55 AM.  The `main` field in `package.json` was changed multiple times, indicating experimentation with build output file names.  The `tsconfig.json` file was also modified; most significantly, the `outDir` was set to `./dist` and the `rootDir` was set to `./src` around 10:39 AM and 10:40 AM respectively. A `.gitignore` file was created to manage version control, excluding `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.env` files.  An `.env` file containing a  POSTGRESQL database URL was added around 11:10 AM, but it was subsequently modified, and potentially truncated indicating an issue with the connection string. The frontend (`memeverse\src`) development started with a basic app component.  Starting around 11:27 AM, React Router was integrated to create routes for a Homepage and Dashboard.  The `App.tsx` file was updated to include routing,  and separate components were created for the Homepage and Dashboard pages.  Styling changes were also introduced in the Dashboard component.
