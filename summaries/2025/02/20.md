# Activity Summary for 2/20/2025

## 3:21:55 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `next-seo.config.ts` and `app\layout.tsx`.  The `next-seo.config.ts` file underwent multiple revisions between 2:25 PM and 2:32 PM, primarily adjusting SEO metadata for the LetterGen website.  Changes included refining the description, image dimensions in the `openGraph` section, and keywords, specifically adding "kreyon" and "kreyon lettergen" towards the end of this period.  The `robotsProps` were also toggled between indexing and not indexing the site. Finally, the structure was significantly simplified, removing the `twitter` and `additionalLinkTags` sections.

The `app\layout.tsx` file was modified extensively between 2:28 PM and 3:03 PM. Initially,  `DefaultSeo` from the `next-seo` library was integrated around 2:29 PM.  The location of the `SEOConfig` import was also adjusted, moving it to a different directory, and subsequently reverting this change.  A significant change occurred at around 2:41 PM.  The code shifted from using the `next-seo` library to directly embedding SEO metadata within `metadata` export using the Next.js built in metadata feature. This involved specifying metadata such as `title`, `description`, `keywords`, `openGraph`, `twitter`, and `robots`.  Further refinements to the `metadata` object followed, particularly in the `openGraph` and `images` sections between 2:44 PM and 3:03 PM, including correcting an image URL and fixing the `openGraph` `type` from `object` to `website`. Consistent changes throughout the updates to this file included adding more descriptive keywords related to the website's functionality ("job application", "kreyon", "kreyon lettergen").  The final modification at 3:03 PM standardized the image URLs used across different sections of the metadata.
