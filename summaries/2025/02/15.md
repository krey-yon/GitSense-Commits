# Activity Summary for 2/15/2025

## 1:28:05 AM
The log shows a series of code changes made between 12:47 AM and 1:27 AM on February 15, 2025, primarily focused on the `layout.tsx`, `globals.css`, `Header.tsx`, and `Footer.tsx` files.

**`layout.tsx`**:  The initial changes (12:47 AM - 12:48 AM) involved importing and using Google Fonts (`Geist`, `Geist_Mono`, and `Inter`).  Around 12:48 AM, the `inter` font variable was added to the body's className, then `Geist` and `Geist_Mono` were removed from the imports and the className at 12:59 AM, leaving only `Inter`.


**`globals.css`**: This file underwent multiple revisions between 1:03 AM and 1:25 AM.  The main focus was the addition of CSS for a wave animation at the bottom of the page, using a background image and keyframes. The body font family was also changed from 'N' to 'Inter'  between 1:08 AM and 1:08:11 AM.  Additionally, there were iterative adjustments to the  `bg-radial-gradient` utility class, modifying the radial gradient's parameters.  The `body` font-family was eventually commented out at 1:25 AM.


**`Header.tsx`**: Several minor edits were made between 1:06 AM and 1:27 AM. These revisions involved mostly styling adjustments to the Sign In and Sign Up buttons,  reducing the `py` (padding-y) value, and removing the `text-sm` class from the "Sign In" button.


**`Footer.tsx`**:  This component was created around 1:09 AM, initially containing just "Footer". It was then progressively updated (1:10 AM, 1:13 AM, 1:14 AM, 1:18 AM) to include the wave animation from `globals.css` and a copyright notice. The file path for the css was also changed from a dedicated Footer.css file to importing the app/globals.css file.


In summary, the changes reflect the development of a website's header and footer components, incorporating styling using Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts, and the implementation of a wave animation effect at the footer.  The font changes seem to be an iterative process to find suitable font. The frequent updates suggest an iterative design and styling process during the development of this webpage.
