# Activity Summary for 2/27/2025

## 10:34:11 PM
The log shows development of a New Year countdown chrome extension.  The `manifest.json` file was repeatedly updated, primarily to change the `chrome_url_overrides` field  (from `newtab.html` to `Counter.html`) and to adjust the icons.  Significant changes to `Counter.html` happened between 10:14:28 PM and 10:14:59 PM, mainly removing a Google font link.  The `style.css` file was updated at 10:15:17 PM and 10:31:46 PM. The first update involved adding a custom font and styling for a countdown, and a search bar, while the second changed the background image. The `script.js` file, containing the countdown logic, was updated once at 10:16:49 PM.  There's a recurring pattern of adjustments to file paths within `manifest.json` specifically related to icon locations.  The final version of the `Counter.html` re-included the google font.
